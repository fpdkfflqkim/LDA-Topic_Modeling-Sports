      "In recent years, many people have been able to enjoy sports activities with high physical demands even in their 50s and 60s due to increased health awareness and lifelong sporting activities. As a result, the age range of patients undergoing anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery has expanded. Our hospital has also been performing ACL reconstruction surgery on patients over 50 years old, taking into account their demands and physical activity levels. While previous studies have compared postoperative outcomes between patients aged 40 and under and younger individuals, there are no reports comparing outcomes in older age groups. This study aimed to investigate the postoperative outcomes of ACL reconstruction surgery in patients aged 50-70 and compare them with those of younger individuals. The subjects consisted of 8 patients under 30 years old (5 males, 3 females, average age 18.4±2.3 years) and 7 patients over 50 years old (all females, average age 56.1±5.5 years). Evaluation items included knee flexion and extension range of motion (ROM), Lysholm score, and knee flexion and extension strength measured using a hand-held dynamometer. The evaluation period was before surgery and at least 10 months after surgery (average 14.5±3.5 months). No significant differences were found between the two groups in any of the evaluation items.\n"

      "The Japanese Society of Lifelong Sports has reached a milestone of 20 years, with its annual conference being held 20 times. Over the years, the Society has tackled a diverse range of research topics, spanning from social sciences to health sciences. This study aimed to elucidate the research trends within the Society by conducting a quantitative analysis of 123 academic paper titles and 622 oral presentation abstracts using KH Coder software. Our results showed that the academic papers comprised 2,459 tokens and 704 unique terms, with the most frequently occurring words being 'sport', 'research', 'activity', 'body', and 'life'. Similarly, the oral presentations consisted of 10,449 tokens and 1,712 unique terms, with the top five most frequent terms being 'sport', 'research', 'exercise', 'activity', and 'community'. While the research trends in academic papers and oral presentations exhibited similarities, some differences emerged. For instance, 'marathon' and 'women' were more prominent in academic papers, whereas 'volunteer' was a frequently used term only in oral presentations. Future studies should adopt diverse approaches to investigate various topics, ultimately contributing to the advancement of lifelong sports.\n",

      "The notion of sports as a lifelong pursuit has been met with skepticism due to the inherent decline in physical strength that comes with aging. This raises questions about whether theoretical models of lifelong development can truly support the concept of lifelong sports participation. \n",
      "\n",
      "This paper tackles this challenge by addressing misconceptions and biases surrounding the topic. As lifelong sports relies on lifelong learning, we delve into the meanings of \"development\" and \"improvement\" to explore the feasibility of establishing this concept. We also examine specific aspects of sports activities through case studies to define a range of educational approaches for lifelong learning through sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our key findings indicate that, according to lifelong learning theory, the pursuit of physical strength and peak performance is an essential aspect of learning, which remains relevant even in old age. Moreover, it is possible to continue learning through sports activities despite declining physical abilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, further research is needed to fully understand the learning potential of sports activities, as not all values related to cultivating lifelong sports participation have been fully articulated. Progress in identifying and describing these values will solidify the concept of sports as a lifelong pursuit. \n",

      "Despite numerous theories on lifelong sport, the conceptual framework and underlying theory remain unclear. In the realm of sports philosophy, Ohashi's work provides a structural elucidation of the concept of lifelong sport, but the question of what constitutes a lifelong sport persists. This study aims to delineate the concept of lifelong sport and propose a model for discussion. The methodology employed is as follows: Firstly, the author examines the meaning of lifelong sport from both political and social perspectives. Secondly, a critical analysis of lifespan developmental theory is conducted, focusing on the body and its life cycles. Finally, the concept of lifelong sport and a corresponding theoretical framework are considered. The key findings can be summarized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Even if lifelong sport is deemed socially important, the question of individual values remains unresolved.\n",
      "2. Erikson's lifespan developmental theory neglects the bodily aspect.\n",
      "3. Lifespan developmental theory can be seen as the conceptual foundation of lifelong sport, enabling a threefold interpretation of its structure: idea, principle, and practice. Importantly, the principles governing lifelong sport should not be derived from lifespan developmental theory but rather from the findings of physical education or sport science, given the crucial role of the body.\n",

      "The 25th Conference of the Japanese Society of Lifelong Sports was held under the theme \"Returning to Our Roots: Toward Systematic Development of Lifelong Sports Studies.\" The keynote lecture and symposium focused on defining and conceptualizing lifelong sports. This paper drew parallels between leisure studies and lifelong sports, reviewing conceptual frameworks and research methodologies in leisure studies to inform trends and issues in lifelong sports research. By applying a typology from leisure studies, we explored the dominant approaches in lifelong sports research. In leisure studies, researchers have traditionally employed both objective (time, activity forms, environment) and subjective (psychological experiences) lenses. The definition of leisure is also determined by either researchers (externally) or participants (internally). Building on these two dimensions, a typology of four research approaches emerged: 1) objective-external, 2) objective-internal, 3) subjective-external, and 4) subjective-internal. A content analysis of papers published in the Japanese Journal of Lifelong Sports revealed a predominance of objective-external and subjective-external approaches in lifelong sports studies. These findings underscore the need for further discussion on conceptual definitions within the academic domain, where external perspectives prevail. Furthermore, accumulating insights from internal vantage points may enhance our understanding and visibility of lifelong sports in Japan. Such steps are crucial for advancing the systematic development of lifelong sports studies.\n",

      "1. Seven motivational factors were identified among aging Kendo practitioners: (a) age-independent Kendo skills, (b) stress relief, (c) moral values, (d) spirit of Kendo, (e) competitive drive, (f) traditional heritage, and (g) family bonding through Kendo.\n",
      "2. No significant differences were found in the motivational factors across different age groups, Kendo training periods, or skill levels among aging practitioners.\n",

      "Abstract: The Comprehensive Community Sports Club has emerged as a vital component in realizing a lifelong sports society, with Japan actively promoting its development nationwide. This study examines the current state of progress towards achieving a lifelong sports society from the perspectives of policy transitions in fostering comprehensive community sports clubs and identifies future challenges. The underlying principles and policy measures for nurturing these clubs as hubs for sporting activities are consistent and responsive to societal demands at different historical junctures, taking into account local sports club development contexts. Community sports clubs, including comprehensive ones, are envisioned as spaces where children, key stakeholders in local communities, can engage in, create, and support sports activities. Moreover, they have the potential to serve as a \"bridge\" for formulating innovative policy approaches, paving the way towards realizing a lifelong sports society by 2020.\n",

      "This paper explores the fundamental motivation to engage in sports from a philosophical perspective, with a focus on establishing the principles of lifelong sports participation. To achieve this goal, the author examines two prominent theories: Japan's \"lifetime sports theory\" and Hans Lenk's philosophical approach to lifetime sports. The main argument is that while existing studies in Japan have highlighted human independence and originality, they neglect the importance of considering various stages of human experience and biological perspectives. This paper addresses these shortcomings by incorporating a philosophical perspective on sports. Building on Lenk's work, the author identifies two crucial aspects of lifetime sports: their potential to enrich life like liberal arts, and the challenges posed by aging. The latter consideration leads to the conclusion that an alternative approach to living is necessary, which the author terms \"pluralistic life.\" This concept encompasses two forms of lifestyle, ultimately leading to the principle that a physically active, pluralistic life should be the foundation of lifelong sports participation.\n",

      "While prior research has emphasized the importance of proactive risk management in organizing sports events, the decision-making process employed by event organizers when faced with uncertain circumstances remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the judgement process underlying the hosting of international lifelong-sport events amidst uncertainty. Through archival analysis and a case study of the World Masters Games 2021, we identified 13 significant elements of uncertainty affecting stakeholders' decisions to host events under uncertain conditions. These included concerns about event value, scheduling conflicts, financial transparency, staffing, equipment procurement, venue availability, pre-event feasibility, participant safety, volunteer recruitment, cooperation systems, transportation and accommodation coordination, and ceremonial feasibility. To mitigate these uncertainties, the Organizing Committee employed a multi-faceted approach, involving stakeholder interviews, reference to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics Games, surveys, and statistical analysis of infectious diseases. This informed their decision to postpone the event to 2022. Our findings provide insights into key uncertainty dimensions in international lifelong-sports events, judgement criteria for postponement, and practical recommendations for event organizers and stakeholders.\n",

The participant group consisted of 10 older adults (average age: 70.3 ± 1.5 years) with an average Kendo experience of 48.3 ± 7.5 years, holding a rank of 7.1 ± 0.73 Dan. A control group of six elderly individuals (average age: 66.0 ± 2.9 years) was also established.\n",

      "The study measured various physiological parameters, including visual functions (Kinetic visual acuity and Flicker test), auditory capacity, balance (standing on one foot with eyes closed), and whole-body reaction time. Additionally, cardiovascular responses were assessed at rest, during a six-minute bicycle exercise (1.5 kp, 60 rpm), and during a four-minute recovery period.\n",

      "A comprehensive survey was conducted across 41 universities in Japan, categorizing respondents into four groups: athletic club members, circle members, other exercisers, and non-exercisers. The findings indicate that over 50% of athletic club members engage in intense exercise exceeding six days a week, surpassing the guidelines for junior high and high schools. This highlights the need for a support system to balance academic and career commitments with athletic pursuits.\n",

      "To maximize the benefits of hosting an event, a strategic approach is essential, focusing on how to create a lasting legacy for the host community. While previous research has explored the impact of single-city international sporting events, there is a lack of understanding about the effects of multi-city events and their implications for smaller host cities. This study examines the development of community capacity during the pre-event stages of the \"World Masters Games 2021 Kansai\" (WMG2021), a wide-area sporting event involving multiple cities. Through document analysis and interviews with key stakeholders, we observed that this type of event fosters cooperation between public and communal sectors across different stages, including bidding, hosting selection, and operational preparation. This collaboration enhances community capacity, encompassing skills and resources, social relations, dialogue structures, leadership, civic participation, value systems, and learning cultures. Our findings suggest that small host cities can establish cooperative systems with other host cities from the initial bidding stage, which further develop into multi-sector collaborations during the preparatory stages to achieve strategic goals. Moreover, event stakeholders share strategies for creating a sustainable local legacy from the early stages of event planning.\n",

      "Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, lottery activities have been strictly prohibited as they were seen to embody corrupt capitalist practices. However, with the introduction of Deng Xiaoping's Reform and Opening-Up policy and the Socialist Market Economy, some provinces in China began to introduce Sports Lottery in 1984. The primary objective was to generate funds for hosting large-scale sports competitions and building sports facilities. A formal, nationwide system for Sports Lottery was established by the Chinese government in 1994. In 1995, the government launched three key programs: the \"Sports Industry Development Program\", the \"Olympic Games Program\", and the \"National Fitness Promotion Program\". These programs continue to shape China's sports policy today. The \"Sports Industry Development Program\" ensures that promoting sports industries aligned with the Socialist Market Economic System guarantees financial security for realizing the other two programs. In this context, Sports Lottery plays a crucial role in acquiring necessary funds for promoting sports at all levels while also driving the development of various sports markets and businesses. To date, 60% of Chinese sports lottery profits have been allocated to the \"National Fitness Program\" and 40% to the \"Olympic Games Program\". The Chinese sports lottery has become a vital source of revenue, supporting government initiatives to promote sports policies at all levels and develop the sports industry by expanding related markets. It is poised to play a significant role in achieving China's strategic sports objectives for the 21st century.\n",

      "In the 1990s, sports for people with intellectual disabilities lacked recognition and opportunities, not only from society at large but also from family members and stakeholders. Against this backdrop, Special Olympics Nippon has been organizing summer and winter national games every four years since its inception in 1994, attracting a growing number of athletes with disabilities and expanding the scope of events held during each edition. Concurrently, the organizers have promoted awareness and understanding of sports for people with intellectual disabilities, leading to increased membership and activity bases nationwide.

      "This study explores strategies for promoting lifelong exercise habits through extracurricular sport activities. Focusing on junior high school students participating in a sports club for the first time, we established a specialized club that allowed members to select exercises tailored to their individual physical abilities. Our research analyzed the impact of this approach on students' interest and motivation towards exercise, as well as improvements in their physical strength, using fitness test results and survey data. The findings indicate that regular aerobic exercise led to significant enhancements in basic physical strength. Furthermore, despite a decline in average fitness scores with age, students maintained a positive awareness of their overall well-being, including their likes, dislikes, strengths, weaknesses, and motivation towards various activities. This study concludes that participation in \"The Physical Strength Improvement Club\" can effectively increase students' core physical strength and broaden their understanding of physical well-being, thereby supporting the development of lifelong exercise habits.\n",

The findings suggest that operating margin is a crucial determinant of mid- to long-term financial sustainability in these clubs. Furthermore, it is revealed that the primary driver of improved operating margins is not increased revenue from business operations, but rather socially supported income streams. Specifically, members who provide vital sources of socially supported income, such as membership fees, subsidies, and grants, are identified as pivotal customers. Integrating these stakeholders into the business model is found to have a positive impact on the financial sustainability of these community sports clubs.\n",

However, CCSCs have not been experiencing steady growth, as evidenced by the rising number of club closures. Therefore, it is essential to develop effective management strategies that can promote sustained growth in CCSCs. While previous research has explored the factors influencing CCSC growth, the current situation remains unclear.

      "1) Objectively, half of the CCSCs have experienced an increase in membership and budget size since establishment. While instructor numbers have risen, support staff numbers have decreased relative to instructors. Sports clubs' business activities have remained stable or improved, whereas cultural activity-focused clubs have maintained a steady pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Subjectively, many CCSCs reported improvements in members' sports life quality, club life quality, and retention rates for management staff and members. However, awareness of CCSCs among local residents, understanding and achievement of their mission, donations, volunteer numbers, and local government influence have not shown significant growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) A significant correlation was found between objective and subjective growth indicators, but high objective growth did not always translate to high subjective growth potential.\n",

      "The promotion of Comprehensive Community Sports Clubs (CCSCs) aims to enhance people's sports experiences and revitalize local communities. However, recent studies have highlighted the challenges faced by CCSCs in achieving sustained growth. While various practical and theoretical factors influencing CCSC growth have been identified, their relative impact remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, this study investigated the organizational factors that shape the growth of CCSCs, with a focus on long-term survival and development. A nationwide questionnaire survey of 596 CCSCs was conducted, categorizing growth into objective and subjective dimensions. The analysis revealed that \"innovativeness\" has a significant positive impact on objective growth, particularly through proactive engagement in new projects and activities. Additionally, six organizational characteristics - \"social change\", \"citizenship/participation\", \"organizational networks\", \"human resource development\", \"innovativeness\", and \"sports expertise\" - were found to positively influence subjective growth. The establishment of a clear mission and its dissemination among local residents emerged as crucial managerial conditions. Notably, the determinants of CCSC growth vary depending on the performance indicators used, highlighting the need for a nuanced discussion on evaluating CCSC growth from policy and management perspectives. Future research should elucidate the mechanisms by which these organizational characteristics promote CCSC growth.\n",

      "Abstract: This study examines the policy process of establishing Comprehensive Community Sports Clubs (CCSCs) in municipalities, seeking to identify the factors that facilitated and hindered policy adoption through a dynamic interdependent model. This theoretical framework consists of three key components: \"measure inner conditions\", \"mutual reference\", and \"bandwagon competition\". When national government intervention occurs, only bandwagon competition is triggered, while the other two factors are dormant. Focusing on the Basic Sports Promotion Plan of 2000, which involved national government intervention, this study finds that bandwagon competition among municipalities was not inevitable, despite expectations. Instead, the inner conditions of each municipality, particularly human resources, played a significant role in policy adoption. For instance, municipalities with abundant human resources were more likely to adopt the policy early on, while those with limited resources hesitated.\n",

      "This paper explores the role of an intermediary network Non-Profit Organization (NPO) in fostering community sport clubs (CSCs), grounded in civil society theory. Operating in the intermediate sphere between the public and private realms, this NPO creates a public sphere that enables individuals to engage in collective action. This study examines the implications of this public sphere, tracing the NPO's evolution from its inception with a newsletter in 1998 to its attainment of corporate status and development of an internet community, culminating in the selection of nationwide promoters in 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing on Albert Melucci's theory of new social movements and Ernesto Laclau's theory of radical democracy, this paper analyzes how individuals transcend their private interests to become citizens with public intentions, thereby creating a public sphere. The newsletter community served as a representative public sphere where collective intentions could be expressed, while the internet community functioned as a free discourse space for individual expressions. These two communities reflect a process of individualization, where individuals transition from private actors to citizens with public aspirations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through these discourse spaces, awareness of structural undecidability and non-recovery of a unique hegemony in sport administration emerged, echoing the \"chain of equivalence\" concept coined by Laclau. The NPO's selection of community sport club promoters among individuals with public intentions created a mobilization mechanism that leveraged information and human resources, independent of political and economic influences. This, in turn, generated a new political hegemony against traditional sport administration. Ultimately, this paper demonstrates how the creation of a public sphere, facilitated by individualization, has paved the way for a new stage in sports politics.\n",

      "Since 1995, the Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology has implemented the Synthetic Community Based Sports Club Establish Project to address diverse regional sports needs. By the end of 2000, 34 areas nationwide had established certified Synthetic Community Based Sports Clubs. However, this project not only created new clubs but also facilitated encounters between local sports clubs and sports promotional organizations, which inevitably led to conflicts. Identifying effective strategies to mitigate these conflicts is crucial for promoting community sports in the future. This study aims to categorize organizational conflicts arising from the project through case studies of newly formed clubs. Using a model that incorporates assertive and cooperative attitudes, each case was analyzed and plotted into five categories: (1) unrelated, where no relationships were established; (2) avoiding, where benefits were concealed; (3) accommodating, where individual interests were sacrificed; (4) compromising, where win-win situations were created; and (5) collaborating, where mutual benefits were sought. The study found that, when properly managed, conflicts can be constructive and lead to innovative ideas and increased organizational creativity. Therefore, flexible conflict management strategies tailored to each category are essential.\n",

Type A clubs offer specialized programs for people with disabilities, Type B clubs allow participation but do not provide tailored programs, and Type C clubs have no disabled participants. The aim of this research is to elucidate the characteristics of each type of club. A questionnaire survey was administered to 1,431 clubs, yielding 425 valid responses (29.7% response rate). The key findings are as follows. Firstly, 34.6% of the 425 surveyed clubs had members with disabilities, primarily those with physical and intellectual disabilities. Additionally, men tended to participate more than women with the same type of disability, except for phonetic, speech, and chewing disorders. Secondly, Type A clubs were found to have more members, larger annual budgets, and a higher likelihood of having a juridical person compared to Types B and C, indicating that individuals with disabilities tend to join clubs with a strong membership base and stable financial resources. Thirdly, Type A clubs were more likely to develop systems for providing information and safety management tailored to people with disabilities and utilize external resources such as local governments, volunteer groups, and other organizations. Lastly, over half of the members with disabilities in Type A clubs chose their club due to acquaintances or welfare-related connections, whereas most members with disabilities in Type B clubs were recruited through public advertisements.\n",

The study focused on users with metabolic syndrome at a community-based sports club in Tokushima. By measuring user expectations prior to project implementation, valuable insights for effective project planning were gained. To do this, six virtual project scenarios were presented to 283 club users, who were asked to determine the additional cost they would be willing to pay for each project. A debit-card formula was used to gauge WTP, without soliciting direct payment commitments. The payment-consent rate was calculated by dividing the number of users consenting to a project scenario by the total sample size. Assuming an effective Weibull distribution function, regression analysis was applied using a least-squares method to estimate the median WTP corresponding to a 0.5 consent rate. Further analysis was conducted using this value.\n",

      "Since the publication of the \"Basic Plan for the Promotion of Sports\" in 2000, there has been a growing trend towards establishing comprehensive community sports clubs across the country. However, many of these clubs face operational challenges due to ineffective management and a lack of viable solutions. Some club managers have expressed interest in obtaining certification as specified nonprofit corporations as a new approach to management. This study examines the management practices of comprehensive community sports clubs that have obtained such certification. Three case studies were conducted, involving T Sports Club, N Sports Club, and F Sports Club. The main findings are as follows: 1) A small number of management staff were responsible for applying for certification, with no significant objections or issues arising during the process. However, these clubs exhibited top-down management styles, a lack of member engagement, and unclear visions for the future, leading to myopic management policies. 2) The certification of comprehensive community sports clubs as nonprofit corporations may inadvertently create separate categories of members who provide and receive sports services, potentially undermining the original concept of a comprehensive community sports club.\n",

A comprehensive literature review and thought listing procedure involving 20 experts generated an initial pool of 274 items specifically related to coaching in community sport clubs. Data were collected from 12 non-profit community sport clubs that offered over 20 sports activities and catered to members of all ages, yielding a total of 269 coaches. To ensure content validity and minimize subjective categorization, triangulation was employed to refine and edit the items, resulting in 43 competency items. Exploratory factor analysis identified seven underlying factors comprising 35 competency items: manner education, cooperative approach, field management, coaching skills, communication with external stakeholders, communication with internal stakeholders, and safety management. The reliability of these factors was confirmed, with Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.803 to 0.930. Confirmatory factor analysis validated the model, with a good fit indicated by χ2/df=2.622, CFI=.87, and RMSEA=.078.

The developmental processes of UCSCs were analyzed through the lenses of knowledge space, consensus space, and innovation space. Additionally, the relationships between UCSCs, universities, and communities were examined from hard, soft, and human perspectives. The findings revealed that a \"consensus space\" emerged during the founding phase of UCSCs, which subsequently developed through the expansion of \"knowledge space\" and \"innovation space\" centered around university human resources. The results showed that universities provided free sports facilities to UCSCs and shared their human resources, while utilizing UCSCs as practical education platforms for students. Furthermore, local residents participated in UCSCs as management staff and coaches, and universities opened their campus facilities to the community as part of their social responsibility, hosting various sporting events for local residents. Ultimately, this study demonstrated that collaboration among the triple helix can foster the growth of UCSCs by working towards a shared goal of community development.\n",

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the history of community life and the legitimacy of establishing a Comprehensive Community Sports Club (CCSC) from the perspective of community residents. Adopting a Life-Environmentalism framework, we focused on the discourses of persuasion and consent that conform to the knowledge accumulated by community groups. The study was conducted in the Hanayama elementary school district in Hitachi City, Ibaraki Prefecture, where community groups have been formed since 1974 to promote civic activities. We examined the history of the Hanayama Community and the process of establishing a CCSC, highlighting the various discourses employed during this process and the knowledge accumulated by community members. Our findings suggest that (1) the discourses used by residents to form the CCSC were rooted in their experiences in community groups; (2) these discourses exhibited contradictions despite a consistent directional tendency; and (3) when promoting community sports, it is essential to conduct in-depth studies examining the history of community life.\n",

While numerous qualitative studies have explored this topic in Japan, few quantitative examinations exist. To address this gap, 177 coaches (109 male, 68 female; mean age = 46.8 years, SD = 15.9) completed surveys assessing organizational culture and commitment. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that three aspects of organizational culture - atmosphere, connectedness, and organizational presence - significantly predicted coaches' organizational commitment. Notably, coaching experience was not a significant predictor of commitment. However, shorter coaching tenure strengthened the relationship between atmosphere and commitment, whereas longer tenure enhanced the relationships between connectedness, organizational presence, and commitment. Overall, this study suggests that acknowledging diverse organizational cultures within a club is positively linked to coaches' identification with and involvement in the organization.\n",

Our goal was to develop a model explaining the interplay between community sport club development and club managers' performance, thereby clarifying the structural relationships involved. This research aimed to provide insights into enhancing the quality of community sport clubs and fostering their managers.\n",

      "The findings revealed that community sport club managers undertook diverse managerial tasks that evolved daily as they contributed to their club's growth. The initial stages were characterized by unpredictability, with managers experiencing qualitative shifts in their duties, from miscellaneous tasks to organizational administration and external coordination. Managers also sought to enhance their capabilities in adapting to these changing circumstances. The resulting model demonstrated reciprocal relationships between the club developmental process, shifting managerial duties, and the enhancement of managerial capabilities.\n",

      "Comprehensive sports clubs are often designed with urban communities in mind, catering to socially independent individuals. However, these models may not be suitable for rural districts where strong community bonds persist. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of comprehensive sports clubs in rural contexts by examining the relationship between local residents' lifestyles and their sporting practices. Using Oguni Town as a case study, we analyzed the social structure of the district and its correlation with sports practices through interviews with local representatives (N=3) and a questionnaire survey (N=252). \n",

      "Our analysis revealed that while the social structure of rural districts exhibits similarities to urban areas in terms of privacy and fluidity, the strong sense of community rootedness preserves the traditional way of life. Notably, this \"village\" character is marked by a tendency to form local groups through intermediate organizations. \n",

      "The findings suggest that the unique lifestyle of rural districts with strong community roots significantly influences the quality of sports practices, particularly in preserving group events. Therefore, comprehensive sports clubs in rural areas should be adapted to the local \"village\" lifestyle, focusing on building networks between intermediate groups rather than functional groups centered around individuals.\n",

Firstly, we sought to identify the key components of outcomes achieved by members of comprehensive community sport clubs through their club experiences, thereby establishing foundational data for developing a \"quality-of-club-life indicator.\" To accomplish this, we generated outcome items based on in-depth interviews with club members. Secondly, we aimed to provide a detailed description of our methodology to ensure the validity and reproducibility of the outcome items.\n",

      "In designing these outcome items, we began by examining the concept of \"club life\" and subsequently established seven hypothetical categories for classifying the extracted outcomes. We then collected data through interviews and questionnaire surveys with club members and selected key items that reflected a rich and fulfilling club life experience. These items were grouped into categories with shared meanings, referencing our initial hypothetical categories. Furthermore, within each category, we subgrouped key items with common themes into subcategories. Finally, to encompass all outcomes attained by club members, we conducted a discussion to reorganize the subcategories and modified the original categories based on the revised subcategory composition. The resulting outcome categories were \"connection\" (9 subcategories), \"trust\" (4 subcategories), \"rules\" (3 subcategories), \"ikigai\" (3 subcategories), \"sport participation\" (12 subcategories), and \"learning\" (3 subcategories). These categories represent the primary outcome items, with their respective subcategories serving as secondary outcome items.\n",

      "Effective management of community sports clubs requires the ability to set goals and build communities through sports, even in the absence of specific solutions. To achieve this, a goal-oriented learning design is necessary, which presents learners with challenges that encourage them to spontaneously organize their knowledge. Research suggests that adaptive experts, who can respond flexibly to new situations using their knowledge and skills, outperform routine experts who only excel at solving familiar problems. Furthermore, organizational success depends not only on organizational factors such as climate and decision-making systems but also on individual competencies, job proficiency, and self-efficacy. This study compares the knowledge structuring and learning processes in two staff training systems: one based on organizational challenges and the other on individual challenges. The results indicate that 1) identifying issues is easier in individual challenge-based training than in organizational challenge-based training, and 2) organizational challenge-based training tends to focus on community sports club activities as occupational duties, whereas individual challenge-based training emphasizes self-growth.\n",

The questionnaire surveyed club managers on administrative evaluations, cognitive and structural social capital, intrinsic motivation, organizational type, and demographic profiles. The analytical approach employed descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, t-tests, and structural equation modeling. The results of the exploratory factor analysis yielded six administration evaluation factors (cooperation system, management system, coaching system, variety of activities, use of club house, and publicity system), two cognitive social capital factors (norms of reciprocity and local trust), and three structural social capital factors (community groups networks, community sport networks, and education networks). The key findings indicate that: 1) in specified nonprofit organizations, administrative evaluations are influenced by community sport networks; and 2) in voluntary organizations, intrinsic motivation is shaped by local trust, while administrative evaluations are affected by norms of reciprocity.\n",

      "Abstract: This study explores an innovative approach to optimize the utilization of public school sports facilities by delegating partial facility management to private organizations, thereby promoting local sports development. The conceptual framework of this research is grounded in game theory's \"Tragedy of the Commons\" and D.C. North's new institutionalism. A comprehensive analysis was conducted using data from a questionnaire survey of incorporated nonprofit organizations operating Comprehensive Community Sports Clubs (CCSC) and interviews with key club representatives. The CCSC members were categorized into four groups based on their operation of public sports facilities and public school sports facilities. The main findings are as follows. Firstly, city administrators should establish contractual agreements with clubs to allocate partial management responsibilities for public school sports facilities. Secondly, it is crucial for clubs undertaking management operations to foster self-regulation among facility users, while maintaining overall administrative control. Lastly, the simultaneous implementation of these conditions generates effective operational synergy between city administrations and club management of public school sports facilities.\n",

      "The implementation of strategic and comprehensive community sport club policies has sparked debate in Japan over the management of extracurricular activities, with a growing emphasis on building relationships both within and outside schools. This study examines the validity of school-centered club management approaches and critically evaluates the trend towards relationship-building. Through interviews with teachers involved, we analyzed cases where initial relationships were formed but eventually dissolved.\n",

      "Our findings reveal that relationships between comprehensive community sport clubs and extracurricular activities often rely on the enthusiastic efforts of a single health and physical education teacher. While many Japanese school teachers feel responsible for guiding daily club activities, they are also open to collaborating with external sports organizations. However, their attitudes towards out-of-school relationships have begun to shift. This study confirms that teachers' occupational culture is characterized by \"complex relationship-building with local residents,\" a strong sense of extracurricular activities within school education, and indifference towards out-of-school activities. In reality, attempts to build relationships between comprehensive community sport clubs and extracurricular activities have failed.\n",

      "This study examines the human network established through relationships between community sports clubs (CSCs) and information network support non-profit organizations (NPOs), focusing on the partnerships that enabled NPOs to receive donations from CSCs across Japan in response to the Great East Japan Earthquake. The analysis is based on 45 CSCs that made donations to NPOs, which conducted support projects for earthquake-affected CSCs over a two-year period from April 2011 to March 2013. To contextualize this phenomenon, we divided the approximately 13-year period from 1998, when the NPOs were established, to 2011, when the earthquake occurred, into three phases and analyzed the requirements for social capital formation in each phase. Our framework consisted of four key concepts: Niklas Luhmann's double contingency theory, Robert D. Putnam's bridging social capital, and Misumi's cognitive base and net base theories. The findings reveal that (1) social capital was shaped by the philosophy shared among CSCs, which was disseminated through NPOs' internet tools; (2) the relationships between NPOs and CSCs constituted a network of uncertainty, characterized by double contingency; (3) individual relationships between similar CSCs formed a net base for connections between similar organizations; and (4) the central role played by certain CSCs in bridging networks connected various CSCs, fostering bridging social capital. Ultimately, NPOs leveraging internet tools established the prerequisites for social capital through these four processes.\n",

      "The development of innovative community sports clubs is a vital topic in our country. Building on social movement theory, we previously proposed an organizational process model for community sports clubs, highlighting the gradual influence of constructive, psychological, and resource factors within the community. However, the role of promotional factors in driving progress through each phase of this model remained unexplored. This study focuses on the intentional promotional factor of public administration for sport, examining the behaviors of staff members in local boards of education as a key influencer in the organizational process. Specifically, we investigate the behavioral dimensions of staff members during the organizing phase. Using mail questionnaires, we collected data from 130 management members (excluding administrators) across 13 clubs established with public administration support. Our results, derived from factor analysis and simple regression analysis, reveal that: 1) The behavioral dimensions of staff members in local boards of education comprise eight factors: coordination, securing support, setting discussion agendas, activating discussions, accumulating credit, consideration, performance emphasis, and information dissemination. 2) We confirm that many behavioral dimensions significantly impact the transition from personal issue perception to common issue perception and from common issue perception to change intention, suggesting systematic and reciprocal relationships among these behaviors. These findings highlight the varying effectiveness of staff behaviors across different organizing phases and underscore the importance of \"timely support\" for successful club organization, particularly in relation to common issue perception.\n",

      "\"This study investigates the characteristics of social capital formation among managers of community sport clubs, comparing those affiliated with specified nonprofit corporations and voluntary organizations. A sample of 18 community sport club managers from the Kinki region was selected, comprising 10 nonprofit corporation-affiliated clubs and 8 voluntarily organized clubs. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using survey items developed by Dudwick et al. (2006) and refined through discussions among research collaborators. The data were analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis with text mining. The study yields two primary findings. Firstly, managers of nonprofit corporation-affiliated community sport clubs tend to foster social capital by building cooperative networks with neighboring clubs, local governments, and community groups. Secondly, voluntarily organized club managers focus on developing internal networks through coordinated use of school facilities. These results suggest that nonprofit corporation-affiliated clubs tend to expand their social capital outward, whereas voluntarily organized clubs tend to concentrate it inward.\"\n",

To address this issue, it is essential to develop an effective management approach. This study explores the development of such an approach by examining the creation, management, and dissemination of mission statements in CSCs.

Additionally, it examined the relationship between members' reliance on their leader and club effectiveness. Data were collected from 39 leaders and 312 members of community sport clubs using questionnaires in 1984. Based on House's Path-Goal Theory, a type of Expectancy Theory Model, and multivariate statistical procedures, the following results were found. Firstly, leaders tended to have more positive perceptions of their own leadership (initiating structure and consideration) compared to their members. This discrepancy was found to decrease members' motivation to achieve goals. Secondly, a smaller difference between leaders' and members' perceptions of leadership was associated with higher club effectiveness. Lastly, even when there was a significant discrepancy in initiating structure perceptions, high member reliance on the leader mitigated the negative impact on effectiveness. However, high discrepancy in consideration perceptions led to low effectiveness, regardless of member reliance.\n",

Instrumentality perceptions refer to the degree to which leaders' behavior is seen as achieving their own instructional objectives or realizing followers' objectives. The study surveyed 63 leaders and 312 members of community sport clubs. The main findings were: (1) a significant correlation between instrumentality perceptions of initiating structure and actual leadership behavior (p < 0.05); (2) a positive correlation between club members' instrumentality perceptions of their leader and their attitude towards the leader's leadership (p < 0.05); and (3) coincident clubs, where leaders' self-evaluation aligned with followers' evaluation, exhibited higher effectiveness compared to uncoincident clubs (p < 0.05). These results suggest that the Expectancy Theory model can predict a leader's initiating structure behavior, and that discrepancies between leaders' and followers' evaluations of leadership influence the effectiveness of community sport clubs.\n",

Tanimoto (2005) identified four key factors that influence the choice between for-profit and non-profit organizational forms: market constraints, financial constraints, legal constraints, and social constraints. He also proposed an organizational portfolio strategy that leverages the advantages of both types of organizations. To validate his assumptions, we conducted case studies on local sports clubs, including Vegalta Sendai Co., Ltd., Montedio Yamagata Inc., Shonan Bellmare, and Tohoku Rakuten Eagles. Our findings confirm Tanimoto's theory, demonstrating its applicability even to highly commercial professional league teams. Additionally, our study reveals that some local teams, such as Tsukuba FC, efficiently utilize their limited resources by adopting a portfolio strategy combining profit and non-profit organizations. In contrast, others, like Shiogama FC Inc., prioritize management through their local network and opt for a nonprofit structure. Our conclusion is that community-based club management often faces financial constraints, making the strategic utilization of a citizenship network around the organization crucial for effective management.\n",

      "The 25th Conference of the Japanese Society of Lifelong Sports was convened under the theme \"Returning to Our Roots: Toward Systematic Development of Lifelong Sports Studies.\" The keynote lecture and symposium focused primarily on defining and conceptualizing lifelong sports. This paper aims to review the conceptual frameworks and research methodologies in leisure studies, and subsequently explore trends and issues in lifelong sports research by applying a typology derived from leisure studies. In leisure research, scholars have traditionally examined leisure phenomena from both objective (time, activity forms, environment) and subjective (psychological experiences) perspectives. The definition of leisure is also determined by either researchers (external) or study participants (internal). Based on these two dimensions, a typology of research approaches is proposed, consisting of four categories: 1) objective-external, 2) objective-internal, 3) subjective-external, and 4) subjective-internal. A content analysis of published papers in the Japanese Journal of Lifelong Sports reveals that objective-external and subjective-external approaches dominate lifelong sports research. These findings suggest the need for further discussion on conceptualizing lifelong sports within the academic domain, where external perspectives predominate. Moreover, accumulating insights through internal perspectives may enhance the understanding and visibility of lifelong sports in Japan. Such steps are essential for advancing the systematic development of lifelong sports studies.\n",

      "The Comprehensive Community Sports Club is envisioned to play a pivotal role in promoting a lifelong sports culture, and Japan has been actively fostering these clubs nationwide. This study examines the current state of delivering a lifelong sports society from the perspective of policy transitions in fostering comprehensive community sports clubs, identifying future challenges. The principles and policies underlying the development of comprehensive community sports clubs as hubs for sports activities are consistent and responsive to societal demands throughout history. The fostering of these clubs has been informed by local community needs and circumstances. Comprehensive community sports clubs are expected to serve as vibrant spaces where children, vital members of local communities, can engage in sports, innovate, and receive support. Moreover, they have the potential to act as a \"bridge\" and inform the formulation of comprehensive policy measures and approaches, presenting new opportunities for delivering a lifelong sports society by 2020.\n",

      "Abstract: This paper explores the fundamental motivation to engage in sports from a philosophical perspective, with a focus on the concept of \"lifetime sports.\" The author examines two approaches to this theory: the Japanese model and Hans Lenk's philosophical framework. While previous studies in Japan have highlighted the importance of human independence and originality, they neglect the nuances of human experience across various stages of life and biological perspectives. Lenk's work, on the other hand, reveals two crucial aspects of lifetime sports: their potential to enrich life as a form of liberal arts, and the challenges posed by aging. The author argues that addressing these difficulties requires embracing an alternative way of living, which is termed \"pluralistic life.\" This concept encompasses two distinct forms, ultimately leading to the conclusion that adopting a pluralistic lifestyle through physical performance is essential for achieving the principles of lifetime sports.\n",

      "The importance of proactive risk management in organizing sports events has been well-documented. However, the decision-making process employed by event organizers when faced with uncertain circumstances remains unclear. This study examines the judgement process involved in hosting international lifelong-sport events under uncertainty. Through an archival analysis of the World Masters Games 2021 and its stakeholders, we identified 13 key elements of uncertainty that influence the hosting of events under uncertain conditions. These include concerns about event value, schedule duplication, financial transparency, staffing, equipment, venue availability, pre-event feasibility, participant safety, volunteer management, cooperation systems, transport and accommodation coordination, and ceremony feasibility. To mitigate these uncertainties, the Organizing Committee employed a four-pronged approach: interviewing relevant organizations, drawing lessons from the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics Games, surveying stakeholders, and collecting statistical evidence on infectious diseases. This strategic approach ultimately led to the decision to postpone the event to 2022. Our study provides insight into the key uncertainty dimensions in international lifelong-sports events, outlines judgement criteria for postponement, and offers practical recommendations for event organizers and stakeholders.\n",

While previous research has explored the impact of single-city international sporting events on host communities, there is a lack of verification for wide-area sporting events involving multiple cities, particularly in small host cities. This study investigates the formation process of community capacity during the pre-event staging of the \"World Masters Games 2021 Kansai (WMG2021)\". Through document research and interviews with key informants, we examined current projects and cooperation between related organizations in host cities. Our findings indicate that a wide-area sporting event fosters cooperation between public and communal sectors across multiple stages, including bidding, hosting selection, and operational preparation. This collaboration enhances community capacity, encompassing skills and resources, social relations, dialogue mechanisms, leadership, civic participation, value systems, and learning cultures. Moreover, small host cities can establish cooperative systems with other host cities from the bidding stage, which are further strengthened through public-private sector collaborations during the preparatory stage to achieve strategic goals. Our results also suggest that event stakeholders share strategies for creating a sustainable local legacy in host cities from early stages.\n",

      "Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, lotteries were banned as a symbol of capitalist corruption. However, with the introduction of Deng Xiaoping's Reform and Opening-Up policy and Socialist Market Economy, sports lottery was reintroduced in certain provinces starting from 1984. The primary purpose of the Sports Lottery was to raise funds for hosting large-scale sports competitions and building sports facilities. A formal national system for Sports Lottery was established by the Chinese government in 1994. The following year, three key plans were promulgated: the \"Sports Industry Development Program\", \"Olympic Games Program\", and \"National Fitness Promotion Program\". These plans remain crucial in shaping China's sports policy today. According to the \"Sports Industry Development Program\", promoting sports industries aligned with the Socialist Market Economic System ensures the successful implementation of the other two programs, while providing financial security. In this context, the Sports Lottery facilitates the acquisition of necessary funds for sports development at all levels, while also driving the growth of various sports markets and businesses. To date, 60% of the profit from China's sports lottery has been allocated to the \"National Fitness Program\", with 40% going towards the \"Olympic Games Program\". The Chinese sports lottery currently serves as a vital source of revenue supporting government efforts to promote sports policies at all levels and develop the sports industry by expanding related markets. It is expected to play a significant role in achieving China's strategic sports objectives for the 21st century.\n",

Focusing on junior high school students who joined a sports club for the first time, we established a specialized club that allowed them to choose exercises tailored to their individual physical abilities. By analyzing fitness test results and survey data, we examined the impact of this approach on students' interests and motivation towards exercise, as well as improvements in their physical strength. Our findings indicate that consistent aerobic exercise improves basic physical strength, while students' self-awareness of their overall well-being remains stable despite a decline in fitness levels with age. This study concludes that participating in \"The Physical Strength Improvement Club\" can enhance students' core physical strength and broaden their understanding of their physical well-being, ultimately promoting lifelong exercise habits.\n",

The findings suggest that operating margin is a crucial determinant of mid- to long-term financial sustainability in these clubs. Furthermore, the improvement of operating margin is driven not by increasing revenue from business activities, but rather by socially supported income. Specifically, members who provide socially supported income, such as membership fees, subsidies, and grants, are identified as vital customers. Incorporating these 'number one customers' and 'supporting customers' into the business model has a positive impact on club financial sustainability.\"\n",

However, recent studies have highlighted the challenges faced by CCSCs in achieving sustainable growth. Despite the identification of various practical and theoretical factors influencing CCSC growth, their relative impact remains unclear. This study investigates the organizational factors that contribute to the growth and development of CCSCs, providing valuable insights for effective management strategies. A nationwide questionnaire survey of 596 CCSCs was conducted, categorizing growth into objective and subjective measures. The results reveal that \"innovativeness\" significantly positively impacts objective growth, with proactive engagement in new projects and activities being a crucial condition. Furthermore, \"social change\", \"citizenship/participation\", \"organizational networks\", \"human resource development\", \"innovativeness\", and \"sports expertise\" all have significant positive effects on subjective growth. The establishment of a clear mission and its dissemination among local residents are suggested as essential managerial conditions. Notably, the determinants of CCSC growth vary depending on performance indicators, highlighting the need for a renewed discussion on how to evaluate and promote CCSC development from policy and management perspectives. Future research should elucidate the mechanisms by which these organizational characteristics foster CCSC growth.\n",

This study investigates the decision-making processes surrounding the Basic Sports Promotion Plan of 2000, which involved national government intervention. Contrary to expectations, our findings reveal that even with national government intervention, bandwagon competition among municipalities did not necessarily ensue. Instead, the inner conditions of each municipality, particularly human resources, played a significant role in policy adoption. For instance, municipalities with ample human resources adopted the policy promptly, whereas those lacking sufficient resources hesitated.\n",

By the end of 2000, 34 areas nationwide had successfully established certified Synthetic Community Based Sports Clubs. However, this project not only facilitates the creation of new clubs but also fosters organizational interactions between local sports clubs and sports promotional organizations, which can lead to conflicts. Characteristic conflicts emerge in the context of this project, making it crucial to identify effective means of resolving these conflicts for the future promotion of community sports. This study aims to categorize organizational conflicts by conducting case studies on clubs formed under the project. Using a model incorporating assertion and cooperative attitudes, each case is plotted into five typical categories: (1) unrelated, where no relationship forms; (2) avoiding, where benefits are concealed; (3) accommodating, where individual interests are sacrificed; (4) compromising, where mutual recognition of problems leads to win-win situations; and (5) collaborating, where organizations understand each other's strengths and weaknesses to achieve collective benefits. The study reveals that conflicts, when managed properly, can be productive and constructive, generating innovative ideas and promoting organizational creativity. Therefore, flexible organizational management is essential for dealing with conflicts constructively, and we must seek tailored conflict management strategies for each category.\n",

Despite their prevalence, many of these clubs face operational difficulties due to ineffective management and a lack of viable solutions. Some club managers have turned to certification as specified nonprofit corporations as a potential new management approach. This study aims to investigate the management practices of comprehensive community sports clubs that have obtained this certification. Three case studies were conducted, involving T Sports Club, N Sports Club, and F Sports Club. The main findings are as follows: 1. A small group of management staff were responsible for the certification process, with no significant objections or issues encountered. However, these clubs exhibited top-down management styles, with many disengaged members and ambiguity among staff regarding future direction and short-sighted policy decisions. 2. The certified comprehensive community sports clubs tend to create a separation between members who provide sports services and those who receive them, which may lead to an organizational structure that diverges from the original concept of a comprehensive community sports club.\n",

The literature review and thought listing procedure yielded 274 initial items, which were then refined and edited using triangulation to minimize subjectivity and ensure content validity. This process resulted in the development of 43 competency items, which were subsequently subjected to exploratory factor analysis. Seven factors emerged, comprising 35 competency items: manner education (5 items), cooperative approach (8 items), field management (7 items), coaching skills (6 items), communication with external stakeholders (3 items), communication with internal stakeholders (3 items), and safety management (3 items). Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the seven factors ranged from 0.803 to 0.930, indicating good reliability. The model was further tested using confirmatory factor analysis, yielding satisfactory fit indices (χ2/df = 2.622, CFI = 0.87, RMSEA = 0.078). The construct validity of the scale was evaluated based on three components: convergent validity, discriminant validity, and content validity. The results demonstrate that this CCCSC scale is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring coach competency at community sport clubs.\n",

      "This study explores the collaborative dynamics between university-based community sport clubs (UCSCs), universities, and local communities through the lens of the regional triple helix model. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives from three UCSCs to gather data. The findings highlight the developmental processes of UCSCs across three dimensions: knowledge space, consensus space, and innovation space. Additionally, the relationships between UCSCs, universities, and communities are examined through hard, soft, and human perspectives. The results show that a consensus space emerged during the founding phase of UCSCs, which then expanded into knowledge and innovation spaces centered around university human resources. Notably, universities provided free sports facilities to UCSCs and shared human resources, while utilizing UCSCs as practical education platforms for students. Locally, residents participated in UCSC management and coaching, and universities opened their sports facilities to the community as a social contribution. The study concludes that cooperative efforts among the triple helix can drive UCSC development towards the common goal of community advancement.\n",

      "Despite the growing interest in community sports, research in physical education and sports management has neglected the intricate relationship between sports and the historical context of community life. This study aims to explore the connection between the history of community life and the legitimacy of establishing a Comprehensive Community Sports Club (CCSC) from the perspective of community residents. Grounded in Life-Environmentalism, this investigation focuses on the \"discourse for persuasion and consent\" that aligns with the knowledge accumulated by community groups. The study is situated in the Hanayama elementary school district in Hitachi city, Ibaraki prefecture, where community groups have been actively promoting civic activities since 1974. The core members of the Hanayama Community played a pivotal role in establishing a CCSC, and this study examines their experiences, the process of establishing the CCSC, and the \"discourse for persuasion and consent\" employed during this process. The findings suggest that (1) community residents' efforts to form a CCSC were rooted in their experiences within community groups; (2) although there was a consistent directional tendency, contradictions existed within the \"discourses for persuasion and consent\"; and (3) when promoting community sports, it is essential to conduct longitudinal studies examining the history of community life.\n",

A hypothetical model was constructed to examine the relationships between membership history, satisfaction, evaluation of the community, residence years, and place attachment, with a focus on differences in membership types. Data from 372 comprehensive community sports club members were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results showed that for members participating in sports programs and using facilities, membership history influenced satisfaction, which in turn affected evaluation of the community, ultimately impacting place attachment. Similarly, for facility-using members, satisfaction influenced evaluation of the community, leading to place attachment. Notably, satisfaction had a significantly greater effect on evaluation of the community than residence years for both types of members, indicating a significant indirect effect from satisfaction to place attachment.\"\n",

      "Coaches in comprehensive community sport clubs are influenced by the organization's values and philosophy, which shape their coaching activities. While numerous qualitative studies have investigated organizational culture in Japanese comprehensive community sport clubs, few quantitative examinations exist. This study aimed to quantify the relationships between organizational culture and coaches' organizational commitment in these clubs. A survey of 177 coaches (109 male, 68 female; mean age = 46.8 years, SD = 15.9) assessed organizational culture and commitment. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that three aspects of organizational culture - atmosphere, connectedness, and organizational presence - correlated with organizational commitment. However, coaching experience in the club did not significantly contribute to commitment. Notably, when coaching experience was shorter, atmosphere influenced commitment, whereas longer experience correlated with connectedness and organizational presence influencing commitment. The findings suggest that recognizing diverse organizational cultures within a club strengthens coaches' identification with and involvement in the organization.\n",

However, their viability in rural areas, where strong communal bonds persist, is uncertain. This study aims to explore the feasibility of comprehensive sports clubs in rural settings by examining the relationship between local residents' lifestyles and sporting practices. Using Oguni Town as a case study, we analyzed the social structure of the district and its correlation with sports practices through interviews with local representatives (N=3) and a questionnaire survey (N=252).\n",

      "Abstract: Community sports club managers require the ability to set goals and foster communities through sports without relying on predetermined solutions. This goal-oriented approach necessitates a learning design that presents learners with challenges, prompting them to spontaneously organize their knowledge. Research suggests that adaptive experts, who can respond flexibly to new situations using their skills and knowledge, outperform routine experts who excel only in familiar problem-solving. Moreover, organizational success depends not only on internal challenges, such as climate and decision-making systems, but also on individual challenges related to competence, proficiency, and self-efficacy. This study compares the processes of knowledge structuring and learning in two staff training systems: one focused on organizational challenges and the other on individual challenges. The results indicate that 1) issue extraction may be easier in individual challenge-based training than in organizational challenge-based training. Furthermore, 2) community sports club activities tend to be viewed as occupational duties in organizational challenge-based training, whereas self-growth receives more emphasis in individual challenge-based training.\n",

The questionnaire survey included items related to administrative evaluations, cognitive and structural social capital, intrinsic motivation, organizational type, and club manager profiles. Data analysis employed descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, t-tests, and structural equation modeling. The results of the exploratory factor analysis revealed six factors underlying administrative evaluations (cooperation system, management system, coaching system, variety of activities, use of club house, and publicity system), two factors comprising cognitive social capital (norms of reciprocity and local trust), and three factors encompassing structural social capital (community groups networks, community sport networks, and education networks). The key findings suggest that: 1) in specified nonprofit organizations, administrative evaluations are influenced by community sport networks; and 2) in voluntary organizations, intrinsic motivation is affected by local trust, while administrative evaluations are influenced by norms of reciprocity.\n",

The theoretical framework of this research is grounded in game theory's \"Tragedy of the Commons\" and D.C. North's new institutionalism. A comprehensive analysis was conducted based on data collected from a questionnaire survey administered to all incorporated nonprofit organizations operating Comprehensive Community Sports Clubs (CCSC) and in-depth interviews with key club representatives. The CCSC members were categorized into four groups according to their operation of public sports facilities and public school sports facilities. The primary findings can be summarized as follows: Firstly, municipal administrators should establish contractual agreements with clubs, delegating partial management operations of public school sports facilities to them. Secondly, it is crucial for clubs undertaking management operations to foster self-enforcement among facility users while maintaining overall administrative authority. Lastly, the simultaneous implementation of these two conditions generates effective operational synergy between city administrations and club management of public school sports facilities.\n",

This study examines the validity of school-centered club management approaches and critically assesses relationship-building trends. Through interviews with teachers involved, we analyzed cases where initial relationships were formed but eventually dissolved.\n",

      "The development of innovative community sports clubs is a crucial topic in our country's sport environment. Building on social movement theory, we previously proposed an organizing process model for community sports clubs. This model elucidates how constructive, psychological, and resource factors in the community influence the organizing process of these clubs as a gradual movement. However, the promotion factors driving progress at each phase remained unexamined. The intentional promotion factor offers a unique perspective on the role of public administration in sport club organization. This study focuses on the behaviors of local board of education staff members as an intentional promotion factor in this process. Our objectives are to identify the behavioral dimensions of staff members during the organizing phase. We collected data through mail questionnaires from 130 management members (excluding administrators) of 13 clubs established with public administration support. The survey consisted of 39 items on staff behaviors and 5 items on club organization. Factor analysis and simple regression analysis yielded the following key findings: 1) Eight behavioral dimensions of local board of education staff members were identified, including coordination, securing support, setting discussions, activating discussions, accumulating credit, consideration, performance emphasis, and information provision. 2) Many behavioral dimensions significantly influenced the transition from personal issue perception to common issue perception and from common issue perception to change intention, suggesting systematic and reciprocal relationships among these behaviors. Our results imply differences in the effectiveness of behaviors across organizing phases and underscore the importance of timely support for club organization, particularly during the critical phase of common issue perception.\n",

A sample of 18 community sport club managers from the Kinki region was selected, comprising 10 nonprofit corporations and 8 voluntary organizations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using items informed by Dudwick et al.'s (2006) framework, which was refined through discussions among the research team. The interview data were analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis with text mining techniques. Two primary findings emerged from this study. Firstly, managers of community sport clubs with nonprofit corporation status tend to foster social capital by building networks with neighboring clubs, local governments, and community groups through collaborative efforts. Secondly, managers of voluntarily organized community sport clubs prioritize network-building within their own groups, facilitated by coordinated use of school facilities. These findings suggest that social capital developed by nonprofit corporation-affiliated club managers tends to radiate outward, while that developed by voluntary organization-affiliated club managers is more inward-focused.\n",

Data was collected from 39 leaders and 312 members of community sports clubs through questionnaires in 1984. Using House's Path-Goal Theory, a type of Expectancy Theory Model, and multivariate statistical procedures, the following results were found: 1) Leaders tend to have more positive perceptions of their own leadership (initiating structure and consideration) compared to their members, which can lead to decreased member motivation for goal attainment. 2) As the difference between leaders' and members' perceptions of leadership decreases, sports club effectiveness increases. 3) Even when there is a significant discrepancy in initiating structure perceptions, high levels of member reliance on their leader can mitigate the negative impact on effectiveness. However, when consideration perception discrepancies are high, even high levels of member reliance cannot prevent decreased effectiveness.\n",

The study surveyed 63 leaders and 312 members of community sports clubs. The results showed that: 1) there was a strong correlation between leaders' instrumentality perceptions and their actual initiating structure behavior (p < 0.05). 2) Followers' positive attitudes towards leadership were significantly correlated with their perceptions of the leader's instrumental behavior (p < 0.05). 3) Sports clubs with coincident leadership evaluations (i.e., where leaders' and followers' assessments aligned) demonstrated higher effectiveness than those with non-coincident evaluations (p < 0.05).

The key findings are as follows: (1) Factor analysis reveals that mothers' lifestyles can be categorized into five factors: autonomy, innovativeness, spectatorship, communicativeness, and wish. (2) Cluster analysis identifies three distinct lifestyle profiles: the sports-fan type, the passive type, and the sports-enthusiast type. (3) The study also explores the sports activities that each cluster is interested in participating in, with results showing that the sports-fan type is drawn to ball games like soccer and volleyball, as well as dance; the passive type is interested in physical exercise and racket sports; and the sports-enthusiast type is enthusiastic about racket sports, physical exercise, ball games like soccer, mountain climbing, and other activities.\n",

      "The social human service market has long been comprised of both commercial companies and non-profit organizations. Similarly, sports club management also exhibits this dual structure. According to Tanimoto (2005), four key factors influence an organization's choice between for-profit and non-profit status: market constraints, financial constraints, legal constraints, and social constraints. He also proposed the organizational portfolio strategy, which leverages the advantages of both for-profit and non-profit organizations. To validate his theory, we conducted case studies on local sports clubs, including Vegalta Sendai Co., Ltd., Montedio Yamagata Inc., Shonan Bellmare, and Tohoku Rakuten Eagles. Our results confirm that Tanimoto's theory holds true, even for highly commercial professional league teams. We also found that a local team like Tsukuba FC effectively utilizes its limited resources by adopting the organizational portfolio strategy. In contrast, another local team, Shiogama FC Inc., prioritizes management through its local network and opted for a non-profit organization. Our conclusion is that community-based club management often struggles financially, making it crucial to harness the power of a surrounding citizenship network for effective organizational management.\n",

      "The Japanese Society of Lifelong Sports has reached a milestone of 20 years, with its annual conference having been held 20 times. Throughout its history, the Society has tackled a diverse range of research topics spanning social sciences to health sciences. This study aimed to elucidate the research trends within the Society by conducting a quantitative analysis of 123 academic paper titles and 622 oral presentation titles using KH Coder software. The results showed that the academic papers comprised 2,459 token words and 704 type words, with the most frequently occurring terms being 'sport,' 'research,' 'activity,' 'body,' and 'life.' In contrast, the oral presentations consisted of 10,449 token words and 1,712 type words, with the top five most frequent terms being 'sport,' 'research,' 'exercise,' 'activity,' and 'community.' While the research trends in academic papers and oral presentations exhibited similarities, some differences emerged: 'marathon' and 'women' were more prominent in academic papers, whereas 'volunteer' was a frequently used term exclusive to oral presentations. Future studies should adopt multidisciplinary approaches to explore various topics, ultimately contributing to the advancement of lifelong sports.\n",

      "Abstract: The notion of sports as lifelong learning has been a contentious issue, with critics arguing that theoretical models of lifelong development may not be applicable to sports due to the inevitable decline in physical strength with aging. This paper seeks to address this challenge by debunking misconceptions and biases underlying arguments related to this topic.\n",

In the realm of philosophy of sport, Ohashi's work provides a structural elucidation of the concept of lifelong sports. However, the fundamental question of what constitutes a lifelong sport remains unanswered. This study aims to delineate the concept of lifelong sports and propose a model for discussion. The methodology employed in this study involves: 1) examining the meaning of lifelong sports from both political and social perspectives; 2) critically evaluating life-span developmental theory through the lens of bodily experiences and life cycles; and 3) conceptualizing a theory of lifelong sports that centers on the sport itself. The key findings of this discussion are summarized as follows:\n",

The life-span developmental theory can be seen as a conceptual framework for understanding lifelong sports, enabling a threefold interpretation of its structure: idea, principle, and practice. Crucially, the principles governing lifelong sports should not be derived from life-span developmental theory alone, but rather informed by the outcomes of physical education and sport science, given the paramount importance of bodily experiences.\n",

      "The 25th Conference of the Japanese Society of Lifelong Sports, themed \"Returning to Our Roots: Systematic Development of Lifelong Sports Studies,\" sparked a crucial examination of the field's foundational concepts. This paper reviews the conceptual frameworks and methodologies employed in leisure studies, applying a typology derived from these approaches to investigate trends and issues in lifelong sports research. In leisure studies, researchers have traditionally explored phenomena through both objective (time, activity forms, environment) and subjective (psychological experiences) lenses. The definition of leisure is also determined by either researchers' external perspectives or participants' internal views. By combining these two dimensions, a typology of research approaches emerges, comprising four categories: 1) objective-external, 2) objective-internal, 3) subjective-external, and 4) subjective-internal. A content analysis of published papers in the Japanese Journal of Lifelong Sports reveals that lifelong sports studies predominantly employ objective-external and subjective-external approaches. These findings underscore the need for further discussions on conceptualizing lifelong sports within the academic domain, where external perspectives prevail. Additionally, accumulating insights from internal vantage points may enhance our understanding and visibility of lifelong sports in Japan, ultimately contributing to the systematic development of lifelong sports studies.\n",

Our statistical analysis revealed the following findings:\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, seven motivational factors were identified among aging Kendo practitioners. These include: (1) the absence of age-related barriers in mastering Kendo skills; (2) stress relief; (3) the moral principles of Kendo; (4) the spirit of Kendo; (5) competitive ambition; (6) adhering to Kendo traditions; and (7) fostering family bonds through shared Kendo experiences.\n",

The study begins by examining the \"lifetime sports theory\" developed in Japan, followed by an analysis of Hans Lenk's philosophy on the subject. The main discussion highlights the limitations of existing research in Japan, which neglects to consider the diverse stages of human experience and the biological aspects of human beings. This paper argues that a philosophical perspective on sports is essential for understanding lifetime sports. Building on Lenk's work, two key aspects of lifetime sports are identified: the potentiality of sports to enrich life as a liberal art, and the difficulty posed by human aging. The examination of this difficulty reveals the need for an alternative approach to life, which the author terms \"pluralistic life.\" This concept encompasses two forms, with the conclusion being that a physically active pluralistic life should be the guiding principle of lifetime sports.\n",

      "While previous studies have emphasized the importance of proactive risk management strategies for sports event organizers, the decision-making process used to determine whether to host an event under uncertain circumstances remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the judgement process involved in hosting international lifelong-sport events amidst uncertainty. Through archival research and a case study of the World Masters Games 2021, we identified 13 key elements of uncertainty that influence stakeholders' decisions to host events under uncertain conditions. These uncertainties include concerns related to event value, scheduling, financing, staffing, equipment, venue availability, pre-event feasibility, participant safety, volunteer recruitment, cooperation systems, logistics, and ceremony feasibility. To mitigate these uncertainties, the Organizing Committee employed a multi-faceted approach, involving stakeholder interviews, reference to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics Games, surveys, and statistical analysis of infectious diseases. This approach ultimately led to the decision to postpone the event to 2022. Our findings provide insight into the critical uncertainty dimensions in the event planning phase of international lifelong-sport events, highlighting key judgement criteria for postponement and offering practical recommendations for event organizers and stakeholders.\n",

While previous research has explored the impact of single-city international sporting events, there is a lack of studies on wide-area events involving multiple cities, particularly in small host cities. This study investigates the development of community capacity during the pre-event stages of the 2021 World Masters Games Kansai (WMG2021). Through document analysis and key informant interviews, we examined current projects and collaboration between organizations in host cities. Our findings show that wide-area sporting events foster cooperation between public and communal sectors across multiple stages, including bidding, hosting selection, and operational preparation. This cooperation enhances community capacity, encompassing skills, social relations, structures, leadership, civic participation, values, and learning culture. Moreover, our study reveals that small host cities can establish cooperative systems with other hosts from the bidding stage onward, and that public, private, and combined sectors work together to achieve strategic goals during the preparatory stage. The results also suggest that event stakeholders share strategies for creating a sustainable local legacy from the early stages of event planning.\n",

      "Since the establishment of the People's Republic of China, lotteries have been banned as a symbol of capitalist corruption. However, with the introduction of Deng Xiaoping's Reform and Opening-up policy and Socialist Market Economy in 1984, Sports Lottery was permitted in some provinces to raise funds for large-scale sports competitions and facility construction. By 1994, the Chinese government had established a formal, nationwide Sports Lottery system. The following year, three key plans were promulgated: the \"Sports Industry Development Program\", \"Olympic Games Program\", and \"National Fitness Promotion Program\". These plans continue to shape China's sports policy today. According to the \"Sports Industry Development Program\", promoting sports industries that align with the Socialist Market Economic System ensures the realization of the other two programs, providing financial security. In this context, Sports Lottery enables the acquisition of necessary funds for promoting sports at all levels while driving the development of various sports markets and businesses. To date, 60% of Chinese sports lottery profits have been allocated to the \"National Fitness Program\" and 40% to the \"Olympic Games Program\". Currently, the Chinese sports lottery serves as a vital source of revenue supporting government efforts to promote sports policies at all levels and develop the sports industry in expanding related markets.

However, recent studies have highlighted the challenges faced by CCSCs in achieving sustainable growth. While various practical and theoretical factors influencing the growth of CCSCs have been identified, their relative importance remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the key organizational factors driving the growth of CCSCs, thereby informing the development of effective management strategies. A nationwide questionnaire survey of 596 CCSCs was conducted, and data were analyzed to clarify the organizational characteristics underlying their growth. The results showed that \"innovativeness\" had a significant positive impact on objective growth, with proactive engagement in new projects and activities emerging as a crucial condition. Furthermore, six organizational characteristics - \"social change\", \"citizenship/participation\", \"organizational networks\", \"human resource development\", \"innovativeness\", and \"sports expertise\" - were found to have significant positive impacts on subjective growth. The establishment of a clear mission and its dissemination among local residents are suggested as essential managerial conditions. Notably, the determinants of CCSC performance indicators varied, highlighting the need for a nuanced discussion on what constitutes CCSC growth and how to evaluate it from policy and management perspectives. Future research should investigate the mechanisms by which these organizational characteristics promote CCSC growth.\n",

By applying a dynamic interdependent model, we clarify the mechanisms underlying municipal policy adoption. This theoretical framework comprises three key components: \"measure inner conditions\", \"mutual reference\", and \"bandwagon competition\". When national government intervention occurs, only bandwagon competition is triggered, while the other factors are sidelined. Focusing on the 2000 Basic Sports Promotion Plan, which involved national government intervention, we investigate whether municipalities engaged in bandwagon competition to establish CCSCs. Contrary to expectations, our findings indicate that bandwagon competition did not necessarily unfold, even with national government involvement. Instead, the inner conditions of each municipality, particularly human resource availability, significantly influenced policy adoption. For instance, municipalities with abundant human resources adopted the policy early, whereas those lacking sufficient resources were more hesitant.\n",

      "Since 1995, Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology has implemented the Synthetic Community Based Sports Club Establish Project to address diverse regional sports needs. By the end of 2000, 34 areas nationwide had established certified Synthetic Community Based Sports Clubs. The project not only facilitates the creation of new clubs but also fosters collaboration between local sports clubs and promotional organizations, which can lead to conflicts. This study aims to categorize these organizational conflicts through case studies of clubs formed under the project. Using a model that incorporates instances of assertion and cooperative attitudes, each case was classified into five typical categories: (1) unrelated, with no relationship formed; (2) avoiding, where benefits are concealed; (3) accommodating, where group interests are relinquished; (4) compromising, which yields mutually beneficial outcomes; and (5) collaborating, where organizational strengths and weaknesses are understood to achieve collective benefits. The findings suggest that conflicts, when managed properly, can be productive and constructive, sparking innovative ideas and enhancing organizational creativity. Therefore, flexible organizational management and tailored conflict resolution strategies for each category are essential.\n",

      "This literature review aimed to synthesize the findings of research on comprehensive community sports clubs in Japan since the implementation of the Sports Promotion Basic Plan in 2000, and to identify potential areas for future investigation. A total of 93 studies published after 2000 were extracted from the Research Database Cinii and categorized into six themes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The categories include: (1) club management research, encompassing establishment and promotion processes, management strategies, significant programs, and member needs; and (2) research on the meanings of clubs, including their functions, effects, and activity descriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "A crucial factor in establishing and promoting comprehensive community sports clubs is \"bridging the channels,\" which involves fostering connections between clubs, governments, existing associations, and participants. Previous studies have been limited by their sociological or business-oriented perspectives; future research should adopt psychological and philosophical approaches to provide a more nuanced understanding of these clubs. Furthermore, qualitative methodologies such as case studies, fieldwork, and ethnographic research are necessary to capture the complexities and realities of comprehensive community sports clubs, which were often overlooked in previous research due to an assumption that the establishment of these clubs is inherently necessary.\n",

      "This study categorizes comprehensive community sports clubs into three types based on their provision for people with disabilities. Type A clubs offer specialized programs for people with disabilities, Type B clubs allow participation but do not offer specialized programs, and Type C clubs do not have disabled participants. The aim of this research is to elucidate the characteristics of each type of club. A questionnaire survey was administered to 1,431 clubs, yielding 425 valid responses (29.7% response rate). The key findings are as follows: \n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, 34.6% of the 425 surveyed clubs had members with disabilities, primarily those with physical and intellectual disabilities. Notably, men with disabilities participated at a higher rate than women with similar disabilities, except for phonetic, speech, and chewing disorders.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, compared to Type B and C clubs, Type A clubs tended to have larger memberships, greater annual budgets, and were more likely to have a juridical person, indicating that people with disabilities prefer to participate in clubs with a strong economic foundation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirdly, Type A clubs were more likely to develop systems for providing information and safety management tailored to people with disabilities, and leveraged external resources such as local governments, volunteer groups, and other organizations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly, over half of the members with disabilities in Type A clubs chose their clubs due to acquaintances or welfare-concerned individuals being present, whereas most members with disabilities in Type B clubs were recruited through public advertisements.\n",

      "This study assesses the feasibility of introducing health promotion projects based on users' willingness to pay (WTP). The evaluation focuses on members of a community-based sports club with metabolic syndrome. By measuring users' expectations before implementing a project, valuable insights can be gained for effective project planning. To achieve this, six virtual project scenarios were created, and users were asked to determine the additional cost they would be willing to pay for each scenario. A questionnaire was administered to 283 users of a community-based sports club in Tokushima.\n",
      "\n",
      "The WTP was measured using a debit-card formula, without requesting direct payment. The payment-consent rate was calculated by dividing the number of users who agreed to pay for a project scenario by the total sample size. Assuming an effective Weibull distribution function, regression analysis was performed using a least-squares method to estimate the median WTP corresponding to a consent rate of 0.5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results show that the WTP for an obesity improvement program is higher than the WTP for purchasing a training machine and staff training costs. Furthermore, having a specialized coach received a higher evaluation in both obesity improvement programs and staff training. The analysis reveals that four key factors significantly influence the results: being a female client, having a sedentary lifestyle, exercising for health, and having a high overall evaluation of club activities. These findings highlight the importance of evaluating residents' expectations before establishing health promotion programs.\n",

      "Since the publication of the \"Basic Plan for the Promotion of Sports\" in 2000, there has been a growing trend towards establishing comprehensive community sports clubs across our country. Despite this, many clubs face various problems due to ineffective management and are struggling to find solutions. In response, some club managers have expressed interest in obtaining certification as specified nonprofit corporations, a new approach to management. This study examines the management of comprehensive community sports clubs that have obtained such certification. Three clubs - T Sports Club, N Sports Club, and F Sports Club - were selected for investigation through interviews. The main findings are as follows: 1. A small group of management staff took responsibility for applying for certification as a specified nonprofit corporation, with no objections or issues arising during the process. However, these clubs operated with top-down management styles, had many apathetic members, and suffered from ambiguity regarding their future direction and short-sighted management policies. 2. The certification of comprehensive community sports clubs as specified nonprofit corporations may lead to a separation between members who provide sports services and those who receive them, potentially creating an organizational structure that diverges from the original concept of a comprehensive community sports club.\n",

      "This study aimed to develop a scale for measuring the competency of coaches at community sport clubs (CCCSC). A comprehensive literature review and thought listing procedure involving 20 participants were conducted to generate items specifically tailored to coaches in this context. Data was collected from 12 community sport clubs, which met the following criteria: non-profit organizations offering over 20 sports activities and open to members of all ages. The total number of coaches surveyed was 269. Through a rigorous process of triangulation, the initial 274 items were refined and edited down to 43 competency items. Exploratory factor analysis revealed seven underlying factors comprising 35 competency items: manner education, cooperative approach, field management, coaching skills, communication with external stakeholders, communication with internal members, and safety management. The reliability of these factors was confirmed, with Cronbach's alpha values ranging from 0.803 to 0.930. The validity of the scale was further established through confirmatory factor analysis, yielding a good model fit (χ2/df=2.622, CFI=.87, RMSEA=.078). The construct validity of the CCCSC scale was demonstrated through convergent validity, discriminant validity, and content validity, indicating that it is a reliable and valid instrument for measuring coach competency in community sport clubs.\n",

As a result, promoting sports activities has gained significance. While individual participation in sports and recreational activities can contribute to personal fulfillment, they also have the potential to revitalize local communities. This study focuses on the phenomenon of synthetic clubs that have sprouted up in numerous cities. Through a questionnaire survey, this research aims to elucidate the impact of these clubs on regional revitalization. The findings will inform policy recommendations for fostering future sports clubs in regional areas, which is the ultimate goal of this research.\n",

      "This study investigated the collaborative relationships between university-based community sport clubs (UCSCs), universities, and local communities, guided by the regional triple helix model. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives from three UCSCs to gather data. The findings revealed that the development of UCSCs can be understood through the lens of knowledge space, consensus space, and innovation space. Additionally, the relationships between UCSCs, universities, and communities were examined from hard, soft, and human perspectives. The results showed that a consensus space emerged during the founding phase of UCSCs, which subsequently expanded into knowledge space and innovation space centered around university human resources. The cooperation between UCSCs and universities involved the provision of sports facilities free of charge and shared human resources. Moreover, UCSCs served as practical education sites for students. In terms of UCSC-community cooperation, local residents participated in club management and coaching roles. Furthermore, the university-community collaboration led to the opening of campus sports facilities to local residents and the hosting of various sport events. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that collaborative efforts among the triple helix can foster the growth of UCSCs and contribute to community development.\n",

      "Despite the growing importance of community sports in physical education and sports management, research has neglected the significant influence of community history on sports development. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring the relationship between community life history and the legitimacy of establishing a comprehensive community sports club (CCSC) from the perspective of community residents. Framed within the Life-Environmentalism paradigm, our investigation focuses on the persuasive discourses employed by community groups to garner consent for the CCSC initiative. The study is set in the Hanayama elementary school district in Hitachi city, Ibaraki prefecture, where community groups have been actively promoting civic activities since 1974. We examine the history of the Hanayama Community and its role in establishing a CCSC, highlighting the diverse persuasive discourses used to secure consent and the accumulated knowledge of community members. Our findings reveal that (1) the persuasive discourses employed by community residents were rooted in their experiences with community groups; (2) while exhibiting some contradictions, these discourses displayed a consistent directional tendency; and (3) it is essential to conduct in-depth, monographic studies on community life history when promoting community sports.\n",

Field research was conducted at 14 meetings held between April 9, 2003, and November 6, 2003, in Kiryu City's \"A\" district, Gunma Prefecture. The fieldnotes employed were a combination of sketches and simultaneous notes. The collected conversation data underwent open coding and focused coding, resulting in the identification of analytical categories. Specifically, a core category, \"justification for the sports club,\" emerged, accompanied by five constituent categories: \"preferential use of public institutions,\" \"superiority over existing sport clubs,\" \"maximizing community center utilization,\" \"leveraging members' social positions,\" and \"embracing local conventions.\" Through these categories, meeting participants sought to justify the establishment of the sports club in this district through deliberation and strategic application.\n",

A hypothetical model was developed to examine the relationships between membership history, satisfaction, evaluation of the community, residence years, and place attachment, with a focus on differences in membership types. Using structural equation modeling, data from 372 club members were analyzed. The results show that for members participating in sports programs and using facilities, membership history influences satisfaction, which in turn affects evaluation of the community and subsequently place attachment. Similarly, for facility-using members, satisfaction affects evaluation of the community, leading to place attachment. Notably, satisfaction has a significantly greater impact on evaluation of the community than residence years for both types of members, resulting in an indirect effect from satisfaction to place attachment.\n",

      "Coaches in comprehensive community sport clubs are influenced by the organization's values and philosophy, which shapes their coaching activities. While many qualitative studies have investigated organizational culture in Japanese sports clubs, few quantitative studies have explored this topic. This study aimed to quantitatively examine the relationships between organizational culture and coaches' organizational commitment in comprehensive community sport clubs. A survey of 177 coaches (109 males, 68 females; mean age = 46.8 years, SD = 15.9) assessed their perceptions of organizational culture and commitment. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that three factors of organizational culture - atmosphere, connectedness, and organizational presence - were significantly related to organizational commitment. Notably, coaching experience in the club did not contribute significantly to organizational commitment. However, shorter coaching tenure was associated with a stronger relationship between atmosphere and organizational commitment, while longer tenure strengthened the relationships between connectedness, organizational presence, and commitment. Overall, this study suggests that recognizing diverse organizational cultures within a club fosters coaches' identification with and involvement in the organization.\n",

      "This study examines highly sustainable comprehensive community sports clubs that collaborate with local stakeholders to address regional issues, and elucidates their processes for developing innovative sports products and effective club management that lead to the creation of solutions-driven products. Through in-depth interviews with four experienced managers and advisors from Clubs A and B, which meet the criteria for \"sustainable clubs\", this research employs Kinoshita's modified grounded theory approach (M-GTA) to analyze the data. The findings are presented in a model diagram that illustrates the process of creating sports products tailored to integrated clubs and regional problem-solving, as well as the community engagement strategies employed by clubs based on their size and development stage. The results reveal that highly sustainable clubs overcome resource constraints by fostering a sense of community through sports and leveraging the social capital of their members. This study suggests that a new market can emerge by shifting the focus from promoting exercise and sports to addressing community living issues through sports. These findings contribute to the management knowledge that enables community sports clubs to address regional problems, achieve profitability, and drive innovation simultaneously.\n",

This study explores the feasibility of a comprehensive sports club in a rural community, examining the relationship between local residents' lifestyles and their sports practices. Using Oguni Town as a case study, we analyzed the social structure of the district through interviews with three local representatives and a questionnaire survey of 252 residents. \n",

Within each category, we further grouped important items with shared meanings into subcategories. Finally, to encompass all outcomes achieved by club members, we conducted a discussion to reorganize the subcategories and modified the hypothetical categories based on the reorganized subcategory composition. The resulting outcome categories were \"connection\" (9 subcategories), \"trust\" (4 subcategories), \"rules\" (3 subcategories), \"ikigai\" (3 subcategories), \"sport participation\" (12 subcategories), and \"learning\" (3 subcategories).

      "Community sports club managers require the ability to set their own goals and build communities through sports, even without predetermined solutions. To achieve this, a learning design that presents a challenging situation can encourage learners to organize their knowledge autonomously. Effective knowledge structuring is characteristic of adaptive experts who can respond flexibly to new situations, surpassing routine experts who only excel in familiar problems. Organizational achievements depend on both organizational challenges (e.g., climate and decision-making systems) and individual challenges related to competence, job proficiency, and self-efficacy. This study compares knowledge structuring and learning processes in two staff training systems: one based on organizational challenges and the other on individual challenges. The results suggest that 1) issue extraction is facilitated in individual challenge-based training compared to organizational challenge-based training. Furthermore, 2) organizational challenge-based training tends to focus on community sports club activities as occupational duties, whereas individual challenge-based training emphasizes self-growth.\n",

A questionnaire was administered to collect data on administrative evaluations, cognitive and structural social capital, intrinsic motivation, organizational type, and club manager profiles. The analysis employed descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, t-tests, and structural equation modeling. The results of the exploratory factor analysis identified six factors influencing administrative evaluations, including cooperation systems, management systems, coaching systems, activity diversity, clubhouse utilization, and publicity systems. Additionally, two cognitive social capital factors were revealed: norms of reciprocity and local trust. Furthermore, three structural social capital factors emerged: community group networks, community sports networks, and education networks. The main findings indicated that, in nonprofit organizations, administrative evaluations are influenced by community sports networks, whereas in voluntary organizations, intrinsic motivation is driven by local trust, and administrative evaluations are shaped by norms of reciprocity.\n",

The conceptual framework of this research is rooted in game theory's \"Tragedy of the Commons\" and D.C. North's new institutionalism. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining data from a comprehensive questionnaire survey of incorporated nonprofit organizations operating Comprehensive Community Sports Clubs (CCSC) with in-depth interviews with key club representatives. The analysis categorized CCSC members into four groups based on their operation of public sports facilities and public school sports facilities. The main findings suggest that city administrators should establish contractual agreements with clubs, delegating partial management operations of public school sports facilities to them. Furthermore, it is crucial for clubs undertaking management operations to foster self-enforcement among facility users while maintaining overall authority. By fulfilling these two conditions simultaneously, effective operational synergy between city administrations and club management of public school sports facilities can be achieved.\n",

The analysis involves 45 CSCs that made donations to NPOs, which conducted support projects for earthquake-affected CSCs over a two-year period from April 2011 to March 2013. To contextualize this analysis, the study divides the approximately 13-year period from 1998, when the NPOs were established, to 2011, when the earthquake occurred, into three phases and examines the requirements for social capital formation in each phase. The analysis employs four conceptual frameworks: Niklas Luhmann's theory of social systems' double contingency, Robert D. Putnam's bridging social capital, and Misumi's cognitive base and net base. \n",

      "The development of innovative community sports clubs is a crucial topic in our country. Building on social movement theory, we previously proposed an organizational process model for community sports clubs. This model highlights how community sports clubs emerge as a movement, influenced by constructive, psychological, and resource factors. However, the promotional factors driving progress through each phase of this model remained unexplored. The intentional promotion factor offers a fascinating perspective on the role of public administration in sport club organization. This study focuses on the behaviors of staff members in local boards of education as an intentional promotion factor in this process. Our objectives were to identify the behavioral dimensions of staff members during the organizing phase. We collected data through mail questionnaires from 130 management members (excluding administrators) of 13 clubs established with public administration support. Respondents rated 39 items on staff behaviors and 5 items on club organization. Factor analysis and simple regression analysis yielded the following key findings: 1) The behavioral dimensions of staff members in local boards of education consist of eight factors: coordination, securing support, facilitating discussion, stimulating discussion, accumulating credit, consideration, performance emphasis, and information dissemination. 2) Our results confirm that many behavioral dimensions significantly influence the transition from personal issue perception to common issue perception and subsequently to change intention. These findings suggest systematic and reciprocal relationships among behaviors across these aspects. The study highlights differences in the effectiveness of behaviors across each organizing phase and underscores the importance of \"timely support\" for successful club organization, particularly during the critical period of common issue perception.\n",

      "This study investigates the characteristics of social capital developed by managers of community sport clubs, comparing those affiliated with specified nonprofit corporations and voluntary organizations. A total of 18 community sport clubs in the Kinki region were selected as samples, comprising 10 nonprofit corporations and 8 voluntary organizations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using items adapted from Dudwick et al. (2006), which were refined through discussions among the research team. The data was analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis with text mining techniques. Two primary findings emerged from this study. Firstly, managers of community sport clubs affiliated with specified nonprofit corporations tend to foster social capital by building extensive networks with neighboring clubs, local governments, and community groups through collaborative efforts. In contrast, managers of voluntarily organized community sport clubs focus on developing internal networks by coordinating the use of school facilities. These results suggest that social capital developed by managers of nonprofit corporation-affiliated clubs tends to radiate outward, whereas that developed by voluntarily organized clubs tends to be more inward-focused.\n",

However, achieving sustainable growth remains a challenge, with some CSCs even facing dissolution. To address this issue, effective management strategies must be implemented. This study explores the creation, management, and dissemination of mission statements as a key approach to promoting CSC growth.\n",

      "This study investigated the impact of discrepancies in leadership perceptions between leaders and team members on the effectiveness of community sport clubs. Additionally, it explored the relationship between team members' reliance on their leader and club effectiveness. Data was collected from 39 leaders and 312 team members of community sport clubs through questionnaires in 1984. Based on House's Path-Goal Theory, a type of Expectancy Theory Model, and using multivariate statistical procedures, the following findings emerged. Firstly, leaders' self-perceptions of their leadership (initiating structure and consideration) were more positive than those of team members, indicating that discrepancies in leadership perceptions led to decreased goal attainment through member behavior. Secondly, as the gap between leaders' and team members' perceptions of leadership narrowed, sport club effectiveness increased. Finally, even when discrepancies in initiating structure perceptions were high, high reliance on the leader mitigated the negative impact on effectiveness; however, high discrepancies in consideration perceptions still resulted in low effectiveness, regardless of member reliance.\n",

Specifically, it examines how leaders' and followers' perceptions of instrumental leadership (i.e., achieving instructional objectives) influence leadership behavior (initiating structure and consideration). The study also explores the effect of discrepancies between leaders' self-evaluations and followers' evaluations on club effectiveness. A total of 63 leaders and 312 members from sports clubs in community settings participated in this study. The results show that: 1) there is a significant correlation between instrumentality perceptions of initiating structure and actual leadership behavior (p < 0.05); 2) positive correlations exist between followers' perceptions of leader instrumentalities and attitudes towards leaders (p < 0.05); and 3) sports clubs with consistent leadership evaluations from both leaders and followers exhibit higher effectiveness than those with inconsistent evaluations (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that the Expectancy Theory model can predict leadership behavior, and that alignment between leaders' and followers' perceptions of leadership is crucial for effective community sports club management.\n",

Through content analysis of recorded interviews with club members, we elucidated the essential characteristics of club activities. Additionally, we examined the \"life histories\" of those involved. Our key findings were as follows: \n",
      "\n",
      "The primary source of resilience was the captain (A), who had suffered immense personal loss due to the earthquake. His motivation stemmed largely from his experiences at Junior Soccer Club C and Club E, which were shaped by Coach M's long-term commitment to Club E and his affectionate guidance. Inspired by his gratitude towards M, A worked tirelessly as captain to maintain a comfortable atmosphere within the club. The resilience that promoted the club's revival was rooted in A's strong sense of responsibility, driven by his desire to pass on the club's traditions to future generations - a priority shared by M even in the face of crisis. A's gratitude towards M originated from the latter's paternal care since A's graduation from Junior Soccer Club C, which persisted before he joined Club E and ultimately evolved into an extraordinary coach-player bond. As captain, A felt deeply responsible for ensuring the club's continued prosperity, leading him to instill his resilience in the team following his personal loss during the earthquake.\n",

      "The social human service market has traditionally comprised both commercial companies and non-profit organizations, a trend also observed in sports club management. Tanimoto (2005) identified four key factors influencing the selection of an organizational form: market constraints, financial constraints, legal constraints, and social constraints. He proposed the organizational portfolio strategy, which leverages the advantages of both for-profit and non-profit entities. To validate this theory, we conducted case studies on local sports clubs, including Vegalta Sendai Co., Ltd., Montedio Yamagata Inc., Shonan Bellmare, and Tohoku Rakuten Eagles. Our findings confirm that Tanimoto's theory is largely accurate and applicable to professional league teams with high commercialization. Furthermore, our study reveals that some local teams, such as Tsukuba FC, efficiently utilize their limited resources by adopting the organizational portfolio strategy. In contrast, others, like Shiogama FC Inc., prioritize management through their local network and opt for non-profit status. Ultimately, our research suggests that community-based club management often faces funding constraints, making it essential to harness a strong citizenship network around the organization for effective management.\n",

The main obstacle lies in the decline of physical strength with aging, which raises doubts about the feasibility of lifelong sports.\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper tackles this challenge by identifying and addressing underlying misconceptions and biases related to the subject. As lifelong sports relies on lifelong learning, we examine the possibilities of establishing this concept by clarifying the meanings of \"development\" and \"improvement\".

In the realm of sports philosophy, Ohashi's work provides a structural clarification of the concept of lifelong sports, yet the fundamental question of what constitutes a lifelong sport persists. This study aims to elucidate the concept of lifelong sports and propose a theoretical model for discussion. The methodology employed involves: (1) examining the meaning of lifelong sports from political and social perspectives; (2) critically evaluating life-span developmental theory through the lens of bodily experiences and life cycles; and (3) conceptualizing a theoretical framework for lifelong sports that focuses on the sport itself. The key findings are summarized as follows:\n",

      "The 25th Conference of the Japanese Society of Lifelong Sports was convened under the theme \"Returning to Our Roots: Toward Systematic Development of Lifelong Sports Studies.\" The keynote lecture and symposium focused primarily on defining and conceptualizing lifelong sports. This paper aims to review leisure studies' conceptual frameworks and research methodologies, and subsequently explore trends and issues in lifelong sports studies using a typology derived from leisure studies. In leisure research, scholars have traditionally examined leisure phenomena through both objective (time, activity forms, environment) and subjective (psychological experiences) lenses. The definition of leisure is also determined by either researchers (external perspective) or participants (internal perspective). Building on these two dimensions, a four-fold typology of research approaches emerges: 1) objective-external, 2) objective-internal, 3) subjective-external, and 4) subjective-internal. A content analysis of the Japanese Journal of Lifelong Sports reveals that lifelong sports studies predominantly employ objective-external and subjective-external approaches. These findings underscore the need for further discussion on conceptual definitions within the academic domain, where external perspectives predominate. Additionally, accumulating insights through internal perspectives may enhance visibility and understanding of lifelong sports in Japan. Such steps are essential for advancing the systematic development of lifelong sports studies.\n",

Notably, these factors did not significantly differ across age groups, duration of Kendo practice, or grade level. Furthermore, certification examinations were found to be a crucial motivator, particularly for sixth-grade holders seeking advancement to the seventh grade. However, prolonged practice was observed to potentially diminish motivation to pursue certification.\n",

This study examines the current state of delivering a lifelong sports society from the perspective of policy shifts in fostering comprehensive community sports clubs, and discusses future challenges. Consistent principles and policy measures are essential for cultivating comprehensive community sports clubs as inclusive sporting hubs. The development of these clubs has been guided by societal demands at various points in history, taking into account local sports club development contexts. Community sports clubs, including comprehensive ones, serve as vital spaces where children, crucial members of local communities, can engage in sports, innovate, and receive support. Moreover, they function as a 'bridge' and will require the formulation of new, comprehensive policy measures and approaches to achieve a lifelong sports society by 2020.\n",

      "This paper explores the fundamental motivation to engage in sports from a philosophical perspective, with a focus on elucidating the principles of lifetime sports. The study proceeds as follows: First, it examines the evolution of \"lifetime sports theory\" in Japan. Next, it delves into Hans Lenk's \"lifetime sports theory\". The main argument is that while existing research in Japan has highlighted human independence and originality, it lacks a nuanced understanding of human experiences across various stages of life and a biological perspective on human beings. This paper addresses these gaps by incorporating philosophical insights from the realm of sports studies. Building on Lenk's work, it identifies two key aspects of lifetime sports: potentiality, wherein sports enrich life as liberal arts, and difficulty, which arises from human aging. The examination of this difficulty reveals the need for an alternative approach to living, which the author terms \"pluralistic life\". This concept encompasses two distinct forms, ultimately leading to the conclusion that \"pluralistic life\" achieved through physical performance should be the guiding principle of lifetime sports.\n",

However, the decision-making process employed by organizers when faced with uncertain circumstances, such as external risks, remains poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the judgment process involved in hosting international lifelong-sport events under uncertainty. Through archival research and a case study of the World Masters Games 2021, we identified 13 key elements of uncertainty influencing stakeholders' decisions to host events amidst uncertainty. These factors include event value reachability, schedule duplication risks, financing opaqueness, staff and equipment procurement difficulties, venue accessibility issues, pre-event feasibility concerns, participant safety and security challenges, volunteer staffing difficulties, cooperation system development obstacles, transportation and accommodation coordination risks, comprehension and agreement ambiguities with hosts, and ceremony feasibility doubts. To mitigate these uncertainties, the Organizing Committee implemented a multifaceted approach, comprising stakeholder interviews, benchmarking against the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics Games, surveys among stakeholders, and statistical analysis of infectious disease data. This strategic approach ultimately led to the decision to postpone the event to 2022. Our research provides valuable insights into key uncertainty dimensions during the event planning phase of international lifelong-sport events, offering practical judgment criteria for postponement decisions and recommendations for event organizers and stakeholders.\n",

      "To ensure that events deliver their promised benefits, a strategic approach is necessary to leverage their potential and create a sustainable legacy for host communities. While previous research has explored the impact of single-city international sporting events on local communities, there is a lack of studies on wide-area sporting events involving multiple cities, particularly in small host cities. This study investigates the formation process of community capacity during the pre-event staging of the \"World Masters Games 2021 Kansai (WMG2021)\". Through document research and interviews with key informants, we examined current projects and cooperation between related organizations in host cities. Our findings reveal that a wide-area sporting event fosters cooperation between public and communal sectors across multiple stages, including bidding, hosting selection, and operational preparation. This collaboration enhances community capacity, encompassing skills, social relations, leadership, civic participation, values, and learning culture, ultimately contributing to the development of a convention preparation project. Our study suggests that small host cities can establish cooperative systems with other host cities from the bidding stage onward, and that public, private, and combined sectors work together to achieve strategic goals during the preparatory stage. Furthermore, our findings imply that event stakeholders share strategies for creating a sustainable local legacy in the host city from early stages of event planning.\n",

      "Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, lottery activities had been banned as a symbol of capitalist corruption. However, with the introduction of Deng Xiaoping's Reform and Opening-up policy and the Socialist Market Economy, Sports Lottery was reintroduced in some provinces from 1984. The primary objective of Sports Lottery was to raise funds for hosting large-scale sports competitions and building sports facilities. In 1994, a formal national system for Sports Lottery was established, followed by the introduction of three key plans in 1995: the \"Sports Industry Development Program\", \"Olympic Games Program\", and \"National Fitness Promotion Program\". These plans remain crucial in shaping China's sports policy today. According to the \"Sports Industry Development Program\", promoting sports industries that align with the Socialist Market Economic System ensures the realization of the other two programs, securing financial support. In this context, Sports Lottery facilitates the acquisition of necessary funds for promoting sports at all levels, while also driving the development of various sports markets and businesses. To date, 60% of the profits from Chinese Sports Lottery have been allocated to the \"National Fitness Program\", with 40% dedicated to the \"Olympic Games Program\". The Chinese Sports Lottery has become a vital source of revenue, supporting government efforts to promote sports policies at all levels and develop the sports industry by expanding related markets.

      "Abstract: This study explores strategies for promoting lifelong exercise habits by examining the effects of new extracurricular sport activities on junior high school students. Specifically, we established a specialized club focused on building physical strength, where students could select exercises tailored to their individual abilities. We analyzed the impact of this intervention on students' interest and motivation in exercising, as well as improvements in their physical strength, using fitness test results and survey data. Our findings indicate that consistent participation in aerobic exercise significantly enhances basic physical strength. Additionally, despite a decline in average fitness scores with age, students maintained a positive awareness of their overall well-being, including their likes, dislikes, strengths, weaknesses, and motivations towards various activities. Ultimately, our study concludes that participating in \"The Physical Strength Improvement Club\" can increase students' core physical strength and broaden their understanding of physical wellness, thereby supporting the development of healthy lifestyles.\n",

The results reveal that operating margin is a crucial indicator of mid- to long-term financial sustainability, and that enhancing this margin is primarily driven by socially supported income rather than increasing business revenue. Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of members who provide socially supported income, such as membership fees, subsidies, and grants, and integrating them into the business model can have a positive impact on the club's financial sustainability.\n",

      "The sustainable development of Comprehensive Community Sports Clubs (CCSCs) is crucial for enhancing the sports life of local residents and innovating the local sports system. However, despite their importance, CCSCs have been struggling to achieve steady growth, as evidenced by the increasing number of club closures. To address this issue, it is essential to develop effective management strategies that can facilitate sustainable growth. While previous studies have examined the factors influencing CCSCs' growth, the current situation remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the current state of CCSCs from a growth perspective and identify the key management issues affecting their development. A nationwide questionnaire survey yielded 734 valid responses from CCSCs, revealing the following findings:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Objective measures indicate that approximately half of the CCSCs have experienced increases in membership and budget size since establishment, although the number of support staff has decreased relative to instructors.\n",
      "2. Subjective indicators suggest that many CCSCs have reported improvements in members' sports life and club life, as well as retention rates for management staff and members. However, awareness among local residents, understanding of their mission, and donations have not improved significantly.\n",
      "3. A significant correlation was found between objective and subjective growth indicators, but high objective growth did not always translate to high subjective growth.\n",
      "4. CCSCs can be categorized into four types based on their growth potential scores: \"high-growth,\" \"low-growth,\" \"subjective growth dominant,\" and \"objective growth dominant.\" Notably, 33.4% of responding CCSCs were classified as \"low-growth\" clubs, while only 16.5% were \"high-growth\" clubs.\n",
      "5. Juridical personality and location in large areas were associated with high growth rates, whereas establishment or support by local governmental organizations tended to result in low growth rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study highlights that CCSCs are not necessarily growing steadily, emphasizing the need for future research to clarify the organizational conditions influencing their growth and develop effective management strategies to achieve sustainable development.\n",

      "The establishment of Comprehensive Community Sports Clubs (CCSCs) has been promoted as a means to enhance people's sports lives and revitalize local communities. However, recent studies have highlighted the challenges faced by CCSCs in achieving sustainable growth. While various practical and theoretical factors influencing CCSC growth have been identified, their relative impact remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the organizational factors that contribute to the growth of CCSCs, thereby informing the development and implementation of effective management strategies. A nationwide questionnaire survey of 596 CCSCs was conducted, categorizing growth into objective and subjective measures. The results show that innovativeness has a significant positive impact on objective growth, with proactive engagement in new projects and activities being a crucial condition. Furthermore, social change, citizenship/participation, organizational networks, human resource development, innovativeness, and sports expertise were found to have significant positive impacts on subjective growth. The establishment of a clear mission and its dissemination among local residents are suggested as key managerial conditions. Notably, the determinants of CCSC growth vary depending on the performance indicators used. Therefore, this study underscores the need for a renewed discussion on how to define and evaluate CCSC growth from policy and management perspectives. Future research should explore the mechanisms by which the identified organizational characteristics promote CCSC growth.\n",

      "This study examines the policy process of establishing Comprehensive Community Sports Clubs (CCSCs) in municipalities, identifying the factors that facilitated and hindered policy adoption through the application of a dynamic interdependent model. This theoretical framework consists of three key components: \"measure inner conditions\", \"mutual reference\", and \"bandwagon competition\". When national government intervention occurs, only bandwagon competition is triggered, while the other factors are dormant. Focusing on the 2000 Basic Sports Promotion Plan, which involved national government intervention, this study investigates the decision-making processes surrounding CCSC establishment. Contrary to expectations, our findings reveal that bandwagon competition among municipalities did not necessarily ensue, even with national government intervention. Instead, the inner conditions of each municipality, particularly human resources, played a significant role in policy adoption. For instance, municipalities with abundant human resources tended to adopt the policy promptly, while those lacking sufficient resources were more hesitant.\n",

      "This paper examines the role of an intermediary network Non-Profit Organization (NPO) in facilitating community sport clubs (CSCs), grounded in the theory of civil society. Operating between the public and private realms, this NPO creates a public sphere that fosters civic engagement. This study analyzes the implications of this public sphere, from its inception with a newsletter in 1998 to its expansion into an internet community and nationwide organization by 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drawing on Albert Melucci's theory of new social movements and Ernesto Laclau's radical democracy, this paper explores how individuals transcend their private interests to become citizens with public intentions. The NPO's newsletter community and internet platform served as public spheres where individuals could express their collective and personal intentions, respectively. This process of individualization, as described by Melucci, enabled the emergence of citizens with public intentions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NPO's online discourse spaces promoted awareness of structural undecidability and the impossibility of a singular hegemony in sports administration, echoing Laclau's concept of \"chain of equivalence.\" By mobilizing individuals with public intentions from the intermediary realm, the NPO created a mechanism that leveraged information and human resources to generate a new political hegemony in sports, independent of politics and economy. This paper discusses how this process has led to a new stage of politicization in sports, marked by increased awareness of structural undecidability and non-recovery of a unique hegemony.\n",

      "Since 1995, Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology has implemented the Synthetic Community Based Sports Club Establish Project to address diverse regional sports needs. By the end of 2000, 34 areas nationwide had established certified Synthetic Community Based Sports Clubs. However, this project not only involves creating new clubs but also facilitates encounters between local sports clubs and sports promotional organizations, which can lead to conflicts. The present study aims to categorize these organizational conflicts through case studies of clubs formed under the project. Using a model that incorporates assertive and cooperative attitudes, each case was plotted into five typical categories: (1) unrelated, with no relationship formed; (2) avoiding, where benefits are concealed; (3) accommodating, with no assertion of group interest; (4) compromising, creating mutually beneficial solutions; and (5) collaborating, seeking collective organizational benefits. The study reveals that, when properly managed, conflicts can be constructive and even generate innovative ideas, making organizations more creative. Therefore, it is essential to develop flexible organizational management strategies to handle conflicts effectively and find suitable conflict management approaches for each category.\n",

Future studies should adopt a more multidisciplinary approach, incorporating psychological and philosophical viewpoints. Additionally, there is a need for more qualitative research, such as case studies, fieldwork, and ethnographic investigations, to provide nuanced accounts of the realities in comprehensive community sports clubs. This is particularly important given that previous research has often overlooked challenges and difficulties due to its presupposition of the necessity of establishing these clubs.\n",

      "This study categorizes comprehensive community sports clubs into three types based on their inclusivity of people with disabilities. Type A clubs offer specialized programs for individuals with disabilities, Type B clubs allow participation but lack specialized programs, and Type C clubs do not involve individuals with disabilities. The purpose of this research is to elucidate the characteristics of each type of club. A questionnaire survey was administered to 1,431 clubs, yielding 425 valid responses (29.7% response rate). The key findings are as follows: 1) Among the 425 clubs, 34.6% had members with disabilities, predominantly those with physical and intellectual disabilities. Notably, men with disabilities participated at a higher rate than women with similar disabilities. 2) Compared to Type B and C clubs, Type A clubs tended to have larger memberships, greater annual budgets, and were more likely to be legally registered entities. These results suggest that individuals with disabilities prefer to participate in clubs with a strong membership base and stable financial foundation. 3) Type A clubs were more likely to develop systems for providing information and safety management tailored to individuals with disabilities and utilized external resources such as local governments, volunteer groups, and other organizations compared to Type B clubs. 4) Over half of the members with disabilities in Type A clubs chose their clubs due to acquaintances or welfare-oriented personnel being present, whereas most members with disabilities in Type B clubs were recruited through public advertising.\n",

The study focuses on users with metabolic syndrome who participate in a community-based sports club. By measuring project expectations prior to implementation, valuable insights can be gained for effective project planning. To evaluate these expectations, six virtual project scenarios were created, and participants were asked to determine the additional cost they would be willing to pay for each scenario. A survey of 283 users from a community-based sports club in Tokushima was conducted.\n",

      "WTP was measured using a debit-card formula, without requesting direct payment. The payment-consent rate was calculated by dividing the number of users who agreed to pay for a project scenario by the total sample size.

Regression analysis was performed using a least-squares method, and the median WTP corresponding to a 0.5 consent rate was computed from the obtained payment-consent rate curve.\n",

      "Since the publication of the \"Basic Plan for the Promotion of Sports\" in 2000, there has been a growing trend towards establishing comprehensive community sports clubs across the country. Despite their popularity, many of these clubs face various challenges and operate without effective management, struggling to find solutions. Some club managers have shown interest in obtaining certification as specified nonprofit corporations as a new management approach. This study examines the management practices of comprehensive community sports clubs that have obtained this certification. Three clubs - T Sports Club, N Sports Club, and F Sports Club - were selected for investigation through interviews. The main findings are as follows: 1) A small number of management staff took responsibility for the certification process, with no major objections or issues encountered. However, these clubs exhibited top-down management styles, had unengaged members, and lacked clear future direction and strategic planning. 2) The certification of comprehensive community sports clubs as specified nonprofit corporations may lead to a separation between members who provide sports services and those who receive them, potentially resulting in an organizational structure that deviates from the original concept of a comprehensive community sports club.\n",

      "This study aimed to develop a scale for measuring the competency of coaches at community sport clubs (CCCSC). Through a comprehensive literature review and thought listing procedure involving 20 experts, we generated 274 items specifically related to coaching competencies in community sport clubs. Data were collected from 12 community sport clubs that met specific criteria: non-profit organizations offering over 20 sports activities and open to members of all ages. A total of 269 coaches participated in the study. To ensure content validity and minimize category classification subjectivity, we employed triangulation to refine and edit the items, resulting in 43 competency items. Exploratory factor analysis revealed seven underlying factors comprising 35 items: manner education, cooperative approach, field management, coaching skills, communication with external stakeholders, communication with internal stakeholders, and safety management. The Cronbach's alpha coefficients for these factors ranged from 0.803 to 0.930. Confirmatory factor analysis validated the model, yielding a good fit between the data and the proposed model (χ2/df=2.622, CFI=.87, RMSEA=.078). The construct validity of the CCCSC scale was established through convergent validity, discriminant validity, and content validity assessments, demonstrating its reliability and validity for measuring coaching competency in community sport clubs.\n",

      "This study examines the coordination and collaboration between university-based community sport clubs (UCSCs), universities, and local communities in the context of the regional triple helix model. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives from three UCSCs to gather data. The developmental processes of UCSCs are analyzed through the lens of knowledge space, consensus space, and innovation space. Additionally, the relationships between UCSCs, universities, and communities are investigated from hard, soft, and human perspectives. The findings indicate that a \"consensus space\" is established during the founding phase of UCSCs, which then develop through the expansion of \"knowledge space\" and \"innovation space\" centered around university human resources. The results show that universities provide free sports facilities to UCSCs and share their human resources with them. In return, UCSCs serve as practical education platforms for students. Furthermore, local residents participate in UCSCs as management staff and coaches, while universities open their campus facilities to the community as part of their social responsibility and host various sports events for local residents. Ultimately, this study demonstrates that collaborative efforts among the triple helix can lead to the development of UCSCs by working together towards common community development goals.\n",

This study aims to explore this relationship by examining how the legitimacy of establishing a \"Comprehensive Community Sports Club\" (CCSC) is shaped by the history of community life, as perceived by community residents. Adopting a Life-Environmentalism perspective, we focused on the persuasive discourses and consent-building processes employed by community groups in promoting civic activities. Our case study was conducted in the Hanayama elementary school district in Hitachi city, Ibaraki prefecture, where community groups have been actively engaged in local issues since 1974. We investigated the history of the Hanayama Community and its role in establishing a CCSC, as well as the various persuasive discourses and accumulated knowledge used in this process. Our findings indicate that: (1) the persuasive discourses employed by community residents to establish the CCSC were rooted in their experiences within community groups; (2) while exhibiting some contradictions, these discourses demonstrated a consistent directional tendency; and (3) understanding the promotion of community sports requires continued in-depth examination of the history of community life.\n",

      "Coaches in comprehensive community sport clubs are influenced by the organization's values and philosophy, which shape their coaching activities. While numerous qualitative studies have explored organizational culture in Japanese community sport clubs, quantitative examinations are scarce. This study aimed to quantify the relationships between organizational culture and coaches' commitment to their clubs. A survey of 177 coaches (109 male, 68 female; mean age: 46.8 years, SD: 15.9) assessed their perceptions of organizational culture and commitment. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that three facets of organizational culture - atmosphere, connectedness, and organizational presence - were significantly related to commitment. However, coaching experience did not emerge as a significant predictor of commitment. Notably, when coaching tenure was shorter, atmosphere was linked to commitment, whereas longer tenures revealed connections between connectedness, organizational presence, and commitment. Overall, this study suggests that recognizing diverse aspects of organizational culture in a club strengthens coaches' identification with and involvement in the organization.\n",

Through in-depth interviews with four experts, including managers and experienced advisors from Clubs A and B, we elucidated the processes by which these clubs develop innovative sports products and management strategies that help solve regional problems. Employing Kinoshita's modified grounded theory approach (M-GTA), our analysis yielded a conceptual model illustrating the creation of sports products tailored to integrated clubs and regional problem-solving. The model also demonstrates how clubs engage with their communities based on their size and development stage. Our findings show that highly sustainable clubs overcome resource constraints by fostering a supportive community through sports and leveraging members' high social capital. This study suggests that shifting the focus from promoting exercise and sports to addressing community living issues can lead to the development of new markets. These results contribute to management knowledge innovation, enabling community sports clubs to address regional problems while achieving profitability.\n",

      "While comprehensive sports clubs are typically designed for urban communities comprising independent individuals, their viability in rural districts with strong social bonds is uncertain. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of a comprehensive sports club in a rural community by examining the relationship between residents' lifestyles and sports practices. Using Oguni Town as a case study, we analyzed the district's social structure and the links between lifestyle and sports practices through interviews with local representatives (N=3) and a questionnaire survey (N=252). Our findings revealed that despite a tendency towards privacy and fluidity similar to urban areas, the rural community's strong sense of rootedness preserved its traditional way of life. Notably, the community was characterized by a propensity for forming local groups through intermediate associations. The analysis showed that the rural district's lifestyle has a significant impact on sports practices, particularly in preserving group events. These results suggest that a comprehensive sports club in a rural district should be tailored to the community's lifestyle, serving as a network builder between intermediate groups rather than a functional entity focused solely on individual members.\n",

These items were grouped into categories sharing common meanings, referencing the initial hypothetical categories. Within each category, we further grouped similar items into subcategories. A subsequent discussion was held to reorganize the subcategories, ensuring that all outcomes achieved by club members were encompassed. The composition of these revised subcategories also informed modifications to the original hypothetical categories. Ultimately, six primary outcome categories emerged: \"connection\" (9 subcategories), \"trust\" (4 subcategories), \"rules\" (3 subcategories), \"ikigai\" (3 subcategories), \"sport participation\" (12 subcategories), and \"learning\" (3 subcategories).

      "Community sports club managers require the ability to set their own goals and foster communities through sports, even in the absence of predefined solutions. To achieve this, learning designs must be tailored to create challenges that inspire learners to organize their knowledge spontaneously. Research suggests that adaptive experts, who can respond flexibly to novel situations using their knowledge and skills, outperform routine experts who excel only at familiar problems. Furthermore, organizational success depends not only on organizational factors such as climate and decision-making systems but also on individual challenges related to competence, job proficiency, and self-efficacy. This study compares the effects of two staff training approaches based on these distinct challenges. The results indicate that 1) extracting issues is facilitated in individual challenge-based training compared to organizational challenge-based training. Additionally, 2) organizational challenge-based training tends to view community sports club activities as occupational duties, whereas individual challenge-based training focuses more on personal growth and self-development.\n",

      "This study investigated the impact of social capital and intrinsic motivation on administrative evaluations in community sports clubs, with a focus on comparing nonprofit organizations and voluntary organizations. A questionnaire survey was conducted to gather data on administrative evaluations, cognitive and structural social capital, intrinsic motivation, organizational type, and club manager profiles. The analysis employed descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, t-tests, and structural equation modeling. The results revealed six factors influencing administrative evaluations: cooperation systems, management systems, coaching systems, variety of activities, use of club house, and publicity systems. Additionally, two cognitive social capital factors were identified: norms of reciprocity and local trust. Three structural social capital factors emerged: community groups networks, community sport networks, and education networks. The key findings indicated that in nonprofit organizations, administrative evaluations were influenced by community sport networks, whereas in voluntary organizations, intrinsic motivation was driven by local trust, and administrative evaluations were shaped by norms of reciprocity.\n",

      "This study explores an innovative approach to optimize the utilization of public school sports facilities by delegating partial management responsibilities to private organizations for local sports development. The conceptual framework is grounded in game theory's \"Tragedy of the Commons\" and D.C. North's new institutionalism. A mixed-methods approach combining a questionnaire survey of incorporated nonprofit organizations operating Comprehensive Community Sports Clubs (CCSC) and in-depth interviews with key clubs was employed. CCSC members were categorized into four groups based on their operation of public sports facilities and public school sports facilities. The findings suggest that city administrators should establish partnerships with clubs, outsourcing part of the management operations of public school sports facilities to them. Furthermore, it is crucial for clubs undertaking management operations to foster self-regulation among facility users while maintaining overall authority. Simultaneously adopting these two conditions creates effective operational synergy between city administration and club management of public school sports facilities.\n",

      "The implementation of strategic and comprehensive community sport clubs policies has sparked debate on the optimal management approach for extracurricular activities in Japan, with a growing emphasis on building relationships both within and outside schools. This study examines the validity of a school-centric club management model, critically evaluating the trend towards relationship-building. Through interview surveys with teachers involved, we investigated cases where initial relationships were formed but subsequently dissolved.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our findings reveal that relationships established between comprehensive community sport clubs and extracurricular activities were largely dependent on the proactive efforts of individual health and physical education teachers. While many Japanese school teachers feel responsible for daily club guidance, cooperation with external sports organizations is often limited to specific teachers. However, our study highlights a shift in teachers' attitudes towards out-of-school relationships, characterized by a complex effort to build local connections, a strong emphasis on in-school extracurricular activities, and indifference towards external collaborations. Ultimately, these efforts have resulted in failed relationships.\n",

The analysis involves 45 CSCs that made donations to NPOs, which implemented support projects for earthquake-stricken CSCs over a two-year period from April 2011 to March 2013. To contextualize this analysis, we divided the approximately 13-year period from 1998, when the NPOs were established, to 2011, into three phases and examined the requirements for social capital formation in each phase. Our analytical framework consisted of four key concepts: Niklas Luhmann's double contingency, Robert D. Putnam's bridging social capital, and Misumi's cognitive base and net base.\n",

      "Our findings reveal that (1) social capital was shared through the philosophy of CSCs, which was disseminated by sport administrative agencies and the Japan Sport Association (JASA), with CSCs serving as a cognitive base accessed via NPOs' internet tools; (2) the relationships between NPOs and CSCs constituted a double contingency, characterized by uncertainty in predicting each other's behavior; (3) individual connections among similar CSCs formed a net base for same-type network connections; and (4) the central role of CSCs in bridging networks connecting diverse CSCs facilitated the formation of bridging social capital. Ultimately, our study demonstrates that NPOs leveraging internet tools can establish the prerequisites for social capital through these four processes.\n",

      "The development of innovative community sports clubs is a crucial topic in our country. Building on social movement theory, we previously proposed an organizational process model for community sports clubs. This model elucidates how community sports clubs evolve as a movement, influenced by constructive, psychological, and resource factors within the community. However, the role of promotional factors in driving progress through each phase of this model remained unexplored. The intentional promotion factor offers a unique perspective on the responsibilities of public administration for sport in organizing clubs. This study focuses on the behaviors of local board of education staff members as an intentional promotion factor in this process. The aim is to identify the dimensions of staff behavior during the organizing phase. A mail questionnaire survey was administered to 130 management members (excluding administrators) from 13 clubs established with public administration support. Respondents rated 39 items on staff behavior and 5 items on club organization. Factor analysis and simple regression analysis yielded two main findings: 1) The behavioral dimensions of local board of education staff members in the community sports club organizational process consist of eight factors, including coordination, securing support, setting agendas, stimulating discussion, accumulating credit, consideration, performance emphasis, and information dissemination. 2) Many behavioral dimensions significantly influence the transformation from personal issue perception to common issue perception and from common issue perception to change intention, suggesting systematic and reciprocal relationships among behaviors in these aspects. These results imply differences in the effectiveness of behaviors across each organizing phase and highlight the importance of timely support for club organization, particularly during the common issue perception stage.\n",

A sample of 18 community sport clubs in the Kinki region was selected, comprising 10 nonprofit corporations and 8 voluntary organizations. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using items developed from Dudwick et al.'s (2006) framework, refined through discussion among the research team. The data was analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis with text mining. Two primary findings emerged. Firstly, managers of community sport clubs with nonprofit corporation status tend to foster social capital by building networks with neighboring clubs, local governments, and community groups through collaborative efforts. Secondly, managers of voluntarily organized community sport clubs prioritize internal networking by coordinating the use of school facilities. These results suggest that social capital formed by nonprofit corporation-based club managers tends to expand outward, while that formed by voluntary organization-based club managers tends to focus inward.\n",

The validity of this four-factor structural scale was confirmed through confirmatory factor analysis. Notably, the instruction opportunity factor showed high values in both Japan and China, with a significantly higher value in China. Structural equation modeling revealed that in Japan, realistic problem recognition positively influenced economic opportunity, and ideological problem recognition positively influenced guidance opportunity. In contrast, these relationships were not found in China. However, a positive impact of ideological problem recognition on economic opportunity was observed in both countries.\n",

As such, policymakers have consistently supported CSCs over the years. However, achieving sustainable growth remains a challenge, with some CSCs facing dissolution. To address this issue, effective management methods must be implemented. This study explores and develops an effective management approach for CSCs by examining the creation, management, and dissemination of mission statements. A nationwide questionnaire survey of 738 CSCs was conducted to investigate this topic.\n",

      "1. The creation and implementation of mission statements were highly correlated. Specifically, a lengthy creation period, lively discussions, awareness of community issues, and a positive attitude towards creating a mission statement strongly influenced the implementation of mission management.\n",

Reflecting the mission statement in the CSC's management cycle and having CSC leadership drive the mission statement were identified as effective management strategies.\n",
      "3. The growth of CSCs was found to be related to the implementation of mission management and the dissemination of the mission statement. Furthermore, permeating the mission statement through mission management implementation can also enhance CSC growth. However, from a membership recruitment perspective, permeating the mission statement may inadvertently discourage non-members from joining the CSC.\n",

Additionally, it examined the relationship between members' reliance on their leader and club effectiveness. A total of 39 leaders and 312 members from community sport clubs participated in the study, which utilized questionnaires administered in 1984. Based on House's Path-Goal Theory, a type of Expectancy Theory Model, and multivariate statistical procedures, the following results were obtained. Firstly, leaders' self-perceptions of their leadership style (initiating structure and consideration) were more positive than those of members, indicating that discrepancies in leadership perceptions can lead to decreased goal attainment among members. Secondly, the smaller the difference between leaders' and members' perceptions of leadership, the higher the effectiveness of sport clubs. Lastly, even when there was a significant discrepancy in initiating structure perceptions, high member reliance on their leader mitigated the negative impact on effectiveness; however, high discrepancies in consideration perceptions led to decreased effectiveness, regardless of member reliance.\n",

The sample consisted of 63 leaders and 312 members from community sport clubs. The main findings were: (1) a significant correlation was found between instrumentality perceptions of initiating structure and actual leadership behavior (p < 0.05); (2) a positive correlation existed between followers' instrumentality perceptions of their leader and their attitude towards the leader's leadership (p < 0.05); and (3) clubs with consistent leadership evaluations from both leaders and members exhibited higher effectiveness than those with inconsistent evaluations (p < 0.05). These results suggest that leadership behavior can be predicted using the Expectancy Theory model, and discrepancies between leaders' and followers' perceptions of leadership affect community sport club performance.\n",

By analyzing recorded interviews with club members and their life histories, we identified the essential characteristics of the club's activities. Our key findings revealed that the primary source of resilience was the captain (A), who had experienced significant personal loss due to the earthquake. His motivation was deeply rooted in his experiences at Junior Soccer Club C and Club E, shaped by the dedicated coaching of M, who had a long-standing commitment to Club E. The affectionate guidance and positive influence of M inspired A's strong sense of responsibility as captain, driving him to maintain a comfortable atmosphere within the club. This resilience was fueled by A's gratitude towards M, which stemmed from their familial bond, established since A's graduation from Junior Soccer Club C. A's determination to pass on the club's tradition to future generations, a priority shared with M, further reinforced his resilience. Ultimately, A's resilience inspired the team and facilitated the revival of the club after his personal loss in the earthquake.\n",

      "The social human service market comprises both commercial companies and non-profit organizations, a characteristic also observed in sports club management. Tanimoto (2005) identified four key factors influencing the choice between for-profit and non-profit organizational forms: market constraints, financial constraints, legal constraints, and social constraints. He proposed an organizational portfolio strategy that leverages the advantages of both types of organizations. To validate this assumption, we conducted case studies on local sports clubs, including Vegalta Sendai Co., Ltd., Montedio Yamagata Inc., Shonan Bellmare, and Tohoku Rakuten Eagles. Our findings confirm Tanimoto's theory, demonstrating its applicability to professional league teams with high commercialization. Moreover, our study reveals that some local teams, such as Tsukuba FC, effectively utilize their limited resources by adopting the organizational portfolio strategy. In contrast, others, like Shiogama FC Inc., prioritize non-profit organization and rely on local network management. The conclusion is that community-based club management often faces financial constraints, making it essential to harness a citizenship network around the organization for effective management.\n",

The principles and policy measures for fostering CCSCs as community-based sports hubs are consistent with societal demands at different historical periods and local sports club development contexts. These clubs, including CCSCs, serve as vital spaces where children, key stakeholders in local communities, can engage in sports, innovate, and receive support.

      "\"This paper explores the fundamental motivations behind participating in sports from a philosophical perspective, with a focus on elucidating the principles of lifelong sports. The study begins by examining the 'lifetime sports theory' developed in Japan, followed by an analysis of Hans Lenk's philosophical approach to lifetime sports. The main discussion highlights the limitations of existing research in Japan, which neglects the diverse stages of human experience and biological perspectives on human beings. This paper argues that a philosophical framework is necessary to fully understand the complexities of lifetime sports. Building on Lenk's work, two crucial aspects of lifetime sports are identified: the potential for sports to enrich life as a form of liberal arts, and the challenges posed by aging. The examination of these difficulties leads to the conclusion that an alternative approach to life is required. This paper proposes the concept of 'pluralistic life,' which encompasses two distinct types, and argues that embracing pluralistic life through physical performance is a fundamental principle of lifelong sports.\"\n",

While previous research has emphasized the importance of risk management in event planning, little is known about how organizers make decisions when faced with uncertain circumstances caused by external factors. This study investigates the decision-making process of hosting international lifelong-sport events under uncertainty, using the World Masters Games 2021 as a case study. Our analysis identified 13 key elements of uncertainty that influence stakeholders' decisions to host events in uncertain environments. To cope with these uncertainties, the Organizing Committee employed various measures, including interviews with relevant organizations, benchmarking against the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics Games, stakeholder surveys, and statistical analysis of infectious diseases. These efforts ultimately led to the decision to postpone the event to 2022. This study provides insight into the key uncertainty dimensions in international lifelong-sports events and offers practical recommendations for event organizers and stakeholders on judging criteria for postponement.\n",

While previous research has investigated the impact of single-city international sporting events, there is a lack of studies on wide-area events involving multiple cities, particularly in smaller host cities. This study examines the formation process of community capacity during the pre-event staging of the \"World Masters Games 2021 Kansai\" (WMG2021). Through document research and interviews with key informants, we analyzed current projects and cooperation between related organizations in host cities. Our findings indicate that a wide-area sporting event facilitates intersectoral cooperation between public and communal sectors across three stages: bidding, hosting selection, and operational preparation. This collaboration enhances community capacity, encompassing skills, social relations, structures, leadership, civic participation, values, and learning culture. Moreover, our results suggest that small host cities can establish cooperative systems with other host cities from the bidding stage onward, with public, private, and combined sectors working together to achieve strategic goals during the preparatory stage. Furthermore, event stakeholders share strategies for creating a sustainable local legacy in the host city from early stages.\n",

      "Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, lottery activities were banned as they were deemed to represent a corrupt capitalist practice. However, with the introduction of Deng Xiaoping's Reform and Opening-up policy and the socialist market economy, some Chinese provinces began to introduce sports lotteries in 1984. The primary purpose of these lotteries was to raise funds for hosting large-scale sports competitions and building sports facilities. By 1994, a formal national system for sports lotteries was established, followed by the introduction of three key plans in 1995: the Sports Industry Development Program, the Olympic Games Program, and the National Fitness Promotion Program. These plans continue to shape China's sports policy today. Under the Sports Industry Development Program, promoting sports industries compatible with socialist market economy ensures the realization of the other two programs by providing financial security. In this context, sports lotteries enable the acquisition of necessary funds for promoting sports at all levels while fostering the development of various sports markets and businesses. To date, 60% of Chinese sports lottery profits have been allocated to the National Fitness Program and 40% to the Olympic Games Program. As a significant source of revenue, the Chinese sports lottery plays a crucial role in supporting government initiatives to promote sports policies at all levels and develop the sports industry by expanding related markets. Its impact will be instrumental in achieving China's strategic sports objectives for the 21st century.\n",

Focusing on junior high school students who joined a sports club for the first time, we established a specialized club that allowed them to select exercises tailored to their individual physical abilities. We examined the impact of this approach on students' interest and motivation towards exercise, as well as improvements in their physical strength, using fitness test results and survey data. Our findings suggest that consistent participation in aerobic exercise improves basic physical strength. Moreover, despite a decline in average fitness scores with age, students maintained a positive awareness of their overall wellbeing, including their likes, dislikes, strengths, and motivations towards various activities. This study concludes that participating in \"The Physical Strength Improvement Club\" can enhance students' core physical strength and broaden their understanding of their physical wellbeing, ultimately promoting a lifelong commitment to exercise.\n",

However, CCSCs have not been experiencing steady growth, as evidenced by the rising number of club closures. Therefore, it is essential to develop effective management strategies that can facilitate sustained growth in CCSCs. While previous research has examined factors influencing CCSC growth, the current situation remains unclear. This study aimed to clarify the current state of CCSCs from a growth perspective and identify key management issues affecting club growth. A nationwide questionnaire survey yielded 734 valid responses from CCSCs. The findings are summarized as follows:\n",

      "1) Objectively, nearly half of the CCSCs reported increased membership and budget scales after establishment. Human resources showed a mixed trend, with growing instructor numbers but declining support staff relative to instructors. Sports clubs' business activities were stable or improving, while cultural activity-focused clubs remained relatively stagnant.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Subjectively, many CCSCs reported improvements in members' sports life quality, club life, and retention rates for both management staff and members. However, local residents' awareness of CCSCs, understanding and achievement of their mission, donations, volunteer numbers, and local government influence showed minimal growth.\n",

      "The development of Comprehensive Community Sports Clubs (CCSCs) has been touted as a means to enhance people's sports experiences and revitalize local communities. However, recent studies have highlighted that these clubs are facing significant challenges in sustaining growth. While numerous factors influencing CCSC growth have been identified, their relative importance remains unclear. To address this knowledge gap, this study investigated the organizational factors that drive the growth of CCSCs, with a view to informing effective management strategies. A nationwide survey of 596 CCSCs was conducted, and the data were analyzed to clarify the organizational characteristics associated with long-term survival and development. The results revealed that \"innovativeness\" had a significant positive impact on objective growth, particularly when clubs proactively engaged in new projects and activities. Furthermore, six key organizational characteristics - \"social change\", \"citizenship/participation\", \"organizational networks\", \"human resource development\", \"innovativeness\", and \"sports expertise\" - were found to have a significant positive influence on subjective growth. The establishment of a clear mission and its dissemination among local residents emerged as crucial managerial conditions. Notably, the determinants of CCSC growth varied depending on the performance indicators used. The findings suggest that policymakers and managers should reevaluate their understanding of CCSC growth and how to assess it. Future research should elucidate the mechanisms by which these organizational characteristics promote CCSC growth.\n",

We employed a dynamic interdependent model, which consists of three key components: \"measure inner conditions,\" \"mutual reference,\" and \"bandwagon competition.\" When national government intervention occurs, only bandwagon competition is triggered, while the other factors are dormant. Focusing on the 2000 basic sports promotion plan, we investigated how municipal decisions were influenced by national government intervention. Despite expectations of bandwagon competition among municipalities in response to national intervention, our findings suggest that this effect was not universally observed. Instead, each municipality's internal conditions, particularly human resources, played a significant role in policy adoption. For instance, municipalities with ample human resources tended to adopt the policy promptly, while those lacking sufficient resources were more hesitant.\n",

Operating in the intermediate sphere between the public and private realms, this NPO creates a public sphere that fosters civic engagement. This article examines the implications of this public sphere, which was established through the publication of a newsletter in 1998, followed by the attainment of corporate status, the creation of an internet community, and the selection of nationwide promoters in 2007. The analysis focuses on the NPO's activities from 1998 to 2007.\n",

By the end of 2000, 34 areas nationwide had established certified Synthetic Community Based Sports Clubs. However, this project not only involves creating new clubs but also facilitates the integration of local sports clubs and promotional organizations, which can lead to conflicts. Identifying effective strategies to mitigate these conflicts is crucial for the future development of community sports. This study aims to categorize organizational conflicts that arise during the establishment process by conducting case studies of participating clubs. Using a model comprising assertive and cooperative attitudes, each case was classified into five distinct categories: (1) unrelated, with no relationship formed; (2) avoiding, where benefits are concealed; (3) accommodating, with group interests compromised; (4) compromising, involving mutual recognition of problems; and (5) collaborating, where strengths and weaknesses are leveraged for collective benefit. The findings suggest that, when managed properly, conflicts can be productive and constructive, fostering creative solutions and organizational growth. Therefore, it is essential to develop flexible management strategies tailored to each conflict category.\n",

Type A clubs offer specialized programs for individuals with disabilities, Type B clubs allow participation but do not offer tailored programs, and Type C clubs do not have disabled participants. The purpose of this research is to elucidate the characteristics of each type of club. A questionnaire survey was administered to 1,431 clubs, yielding 425 valid responses (29.7% response rate). The key findings are as follows: Firstly, 34.6% of the 425 clubs had members with disabilities, predominantly those with physical and intellectual disabilities. Notably, men with disabilities participated at a higher rate than women with similar disabilities, except for phonetic, speech, and chewing disorders. Secondly, Type A clubs were found to have more members, larger annual budgets, and a higher likelihood of having a juridical person, indicating that individuals with disabilities tend to join clubs with greater resources and stability. Thirdly, Type A clubs are more likely to develop systems for providing information and safety management tailored to people with disabilities, and utilize external resources such as local governments and volunteer groups. Lastly, over half of the members with disabilities in Type A clubs chose their clubs due to personal connections, whereas most members with disabilities in Type B clubs were recruited through public advertisements.\n",

Despite their popularity, many of these clubs face operational challenges due to ineffective management and an inability to find solutions. Some club managers have shown interest in obtaining certification as specified nonprofit corporations, a new approach to management. This study examines the management practices of comprehensive community sports clubs that have obtained this certification. Three clubs - T Sports Club, N Sports Club, and F Sports Club - were selected for investigation through interviews. The main findings are as follows: 1. A small group of management staff took responsibility for applying for certification, with no objections or issues encountered during the process. However, these clubs exhibited top-down management styles, had many disengaged members, and suffered from unclear future directions and short-sighted policies. 2. The certified comprehensive community sports clubs tended to separate members who provide sports services from those who receive them, which may lead to an organizational structure that deviates from the original concept of a comprehensive community sports club.\n",

A comprehensive literature review and thought listing procedure involving 20 participants were conducted to generate items specifically tailored to coaches in this context. Data was collected from 12 community sport clubs, selected based on their non-profit status, provision of over 20 sports activities, and open membership policy for all ages. The total number of coaches surveyed was 269. Following a thorough literature review and thought listing procedure, 274 items were initially generated. To ensure content validity and minimize subjective categorization, triangulation was employed to refine and edit the items, resulting in 43 competency items. Exploratory factor analysis revealed seven distinct factors comprising 35 competency items: manner education (5 items), cooperative approach (8 items), field management (7 items), coaching skills (6 items), external communication (3 items), internal communication (3 items), and safety management (3 items). Cronbach's alpha coefficients for the seven factors ranged from 0.803 to 0.930, indicating high reliability. The scale was further validated using confirmatory factor analysis, yielding a good model fit with χ2/df = 2.622, CFI = 0.87, and RMSEA = 0.078.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted with representatives from three UCSCs to gather data. The findings highlight the development processes of UCSCs from three distinct perspectives: knowledge space, consensus space, and innovation space. Furthermore, the relationships between UCSCs, universities, and communities are examined through hard, soft, and human resource frameworks. The results show that a \"consensus space\" emerged during the founding phase of UCSCs, which subsequently expanded into \"knowledge space\" and \"innovation space\" centered around university human resources. Notably, the university provided its campus sports facilities free of charge to UCSCs and shared its human resources. In return, UCSCs served as practical education platforms for students. Additionally, local residents participated in UCSC management and coaching, while the university opened its sports facilities to the community as part of its social responsibility initiatives. The study concludes that collaborative efforts among the triple helix stakeholders can foster UCSC development by working towards a shared goal of community enrichment.\n",

This study aimed to explore the relationship between the history of community life and the legitimacy of establishing a comprehensive community sports club (CCSC) from the perspective of community residents. Adopting a Life-Environmentalism approach, this investigation focused on the \"discourse for persuasion and consent\" that aligns with the collective knowledge accumulated by community groups. The study was conducted in the Hanayama elementary school district in Hitachi city, Ibaraki prefecture, where community groups have been actively promoting civic activities since 1974. The Hanayama Community, a core group of residents, played a pivotal role in establishing a CCSC. This research chronicles the history of the Hanayama Community and the establishment process of the CCSC, analyzing the various \"discourses for persuasion and consent\" employed during this process and the accumulated knowledge of community members. The findings suggest that: (1) the \"discourse for persuasion and consent\" used by community residents to form the CCSC was rooted in their experiences within community groups; (2) although exhibiting some contradictions, these discourses demonstrated a consistent directional tendency; and (3) when promoting community sports, it is essential to conduct in-depth case studies that examine the history of community life.\n",

The results show that for members participating in sports programs and utilizing facilities, membership history influences satisfaction, which in turn affects community evaluation, ultimately leading to place attachment. For facility-using members, satisfaction was found to impact community evaluation, subsequently affecting place attachment. Notably, for both types of members, satisfaction has a significantly greater effect on community evaluation than residence years, indicating a significant indirect effect from satisfaction to place attachment.\"\n",

A questionnaire survey was administered to 177 coaches (109 males, 68 females; mean age = 46.8 years, SD = 15.9), assessing their perceptions of organizational culture and commitment. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that three facets of organizational culture - atmosphere, connectedness, and organizational presence - significantly predicted organizational commitment. However, coaching experience did not emerge as a significant contributor to commitment. Notably, when coaching experience was shorter, atmosphere was linked to stronger commitment, whereas connectedness and organizational presence were associated with commitment when coaches had longer tenure. Overall, the study suggests that recognizing diverse aspects of organizational culture within a club strengthens a coach's identification with and involvement in the organization.\n",

      "This study examines the operations of highly sustainable comprehensive community sports clubs that collaborate with local stakeholders to address regional issues. Through in-depth interviews with four experts, including managers and former advisors from Clubs A and B, which meet the \"sustainable club\" criteria, this research clarifies the processes underlying the development of sports products that help solve regional problems. Using Kinoshita's modified grounded theory approach (M-GTA), a model diagram was designed to illustrate the process of creating sports products tailored to integrated clubs and addressing regional issues, as well as the community engagement strategies employed by these clubs based on their size and development stage. The findings reveal that highly sustainable clubs overcome resource constraints by fostering a supportive community through sports and leveraging the social capital of club members. This study also proposes a new market opportunity by shifting the focus from promoting exercise and sports to addressing community living issues through sports. These results contribute to the development of innovative management knowledge, enabling community sports clubs to solve regional problems while achieving profitability.\n",

Our goal was to develop a model explaining the interplay between community sport club development and managerial performance, thereby clarifying the structural dynamics underlying this relationship. This endeavor aimed to provide insights into enhancing the quality of community sport clubs and fostering effective club management.\n",

      "The findings revealed that community sport club managers undertook diverse managerial tasks that evolved daily as they contributed to their club's growth. The initial stages were characterized by unpredictability, with managers experiencing qualitative shifts in their duties, from miscellaneous tasks to organizational administration and external coordination. Managers also sought to enhance their capabilities to handle these varied tasks amidst changing circumstances. The resulting model demonstrated a reciprocal relationship between the club development process, shifting managerial duties, and the enhancement of managerial capability.\n",

      "Comprehensive sports clubs are typically designed for urban communities consisting of socially independent individuals. However, such clubs may not be viable in rural areas where strong communal relationships prevail. This study aimed to explore the feasibility of comprehensive sports clubs in rural settings by examining the relationship between local residents' lifestyles and sports practices. Using Oguni Town as a case study, we analyzed the social structure of the district and the interplay between lifestyle and sports practices through interviews with local representatives (N=3) and a questionnaire survey (N=252). \n",
      "\n",
      "Our analysis revealed that while the rural area exhibited tendencies towards privacy and fluidity similar to urban areas, its strong communal roots preserved the community's life structure. Notably, the 'village' characteristics included a propensity for forming local groups through intermediate group activities. \n",

      "The findings suggest that the life structure of a rural district with strong communal ties significantly influences the quality of sports practices, particularly in preserving group events. Therefore, comprehensive sports clubs in rural areas should adapt to the community's lifestyle and focus on building networks between intermediate groups rather than solely catering to individual needs.\n",

The study was conducted from September 10 to October 24, 2011, using operational materials analysis through interviews with management and participants. Over an 11-year period, the club's membership grew significantly from 20 in 2000 to 794 in 2011. A key feature of the club is its all-parents coaching system, which aims to foster \"father-child bonding\" and promote sports activities among children.\n",

The selected items were grouped into categories with shared meanings, referencing the initial hypothetical categories. Furthermore, within each category, we grouped similar items into subcategories. Finally, to encompass all outcomes attained by club members, we conducted a discussion to reorganize the subcategories and modified the hypothetical categories accordingly. The resulting outcome categories comprised \"connection\" (9 subcategories), \"trust\" (4 subcategories), \"rules\" (3 subcategories), \"ikigai\" (3 subcategories), \"sport participation\" (12 subcategories), and \"learning\" (3 subcategories). These categories represent primary outcome items, with their corresponding subcategories serving as secondary outcome items.\n",

      "Community sports club managers require the ability to set their own goals and build communities through sports, even in the absence of specific solutions. To achieve this, a goal-oriented learning design is necessary, which presents learners with challenges that encourage them to spontaneously organize their knowledge. Research suggests that adaptive experts, who can respond flexibly to new situations using their skills and knowledge, outperform routine experts who excel only at familiar problems. Moreover, organizational achievements depend on both organizational challenges (e.g., climate and decision-making systems) and individual challenges related to competence, job proficiency, and self-efficacy. This study compares the knowledge structuring and learning processes in two staff training systems: one based on organizational challenges and the other on individual challenges. The results reveal that 1) issue extraction is easier in individual challenge-based training than in organizational challenge-based training. Furthermore, 2) in organizational challenge-based training, community sports club activities tend to be viewed as an occupation or duty, whereas individual challenge-based training focuses more on personal growth and self-improvement.\n",

A questionnaire was administered to gather data on administrative evaluations, cognitive and structural social capital, intrinsic motivation, organizational type, and club manager profiles. The analysis employed descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, t-tests, and structural equation modeling. The results of the exploratory factor analysis identified six factors influencing administrative evaluations: cooperation system, management system, coaching system, variety of activities, use of club house, and publicity system. Additionally, two cognitive social capital factors emerged: norms of reciprocity and local trust. Three structural social capital factors were also revealed: community groups networks, community sport networks, and education networks. The key findings indicated that, for specified nonprofit organizations, administrative evaluations were influenced by community sport networks. In contrast, for voluntary organizations, intrinsic motivation was influenced by local trust, and administrative evaluations were influenced by norms of reciprocity.\n",

The conceptual framework is grounded in game theory's \"Tragedy of the Commons\" and D.C. North's new institutionalism. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining questionnaire survey data from incorporated nonprofit organizations operating Comprehensive Community Sports Clubs (CCSC) with in-depth interviews from key clubs. CCSC members were categorized into four groups based on their operation of public sport facilities and public school sports facilities. The primary findings suggest that: (1) municipal administrators should establish contracts with clubs to allocate partial management operations of public school sports facilities; (2) clubs undertaking management operations should foster self-enforcement among facility users, while maintaining overall authority; and (3) concurrently adopting the first two conditions generates effective operational synergy between city administration and club management of public school sports facilities.\n",

This study examines the validity of school-centered club management models, critically evaluating the trend towards relationship-building. Through interview surveys with teachers involved, we investigate cases where initial relationships were formed but eventually dissolved.\n",

While many Japanese school teachers take responsibility for daily club guidance, they are also open to collaborating with external sports organizations. However, their attitudes towards out-of-school activities have begun to shift. This study highlights the occupational culture of teachers, characterized by \"reluctant relationship-building with local residents,\" a strong focus on in-school extracurricular activities, and a lack of interest in out-of-school activities. In reality, attempts to build relationships between comprehensive community sport clubs and extracurricular activities ultimately failed.\n",

The analysis involves 45 CSCs that made donations to NPOs, which had conducted support projects for earthquake-affected CSCs over a two-year period from April 2011 to March 2013. To understand the formation of social capital, we divided the 13-year period from 1998 to 2011 into three phases and analyzed the requirements for social capital in each phase using four conceptual frameworks: Niklas Luhmann's double contingency, Robert D. Putnam's bridging social capital, and Misumi's cognitive base and net base. Our findings reveal that (1) NPOs shared a common philosophy with CSCs, which was facilitated by internet tools as a cognitive base; (2) the relationships between NPOs and CSCs formed a network of uncertainty, characterized by double contingency; (3) individual connections between similar CSCs constituted a net base for same-type networks; and (4) central CSCs played a crucial role in forming bridging social capital through their connections with various CSCs. Thus, NPOs that utilized internet tools successfully established the requirements for social capital through these four processes.\n",

      "The development of innovative community sports clubs is a vital topic in our country. Building on social movement theory, we previously proposed an organizing process model for community sports clubs, highlighting the gradual influence of constructive, psychological, and resource factors within the community. However, the role of intentional promotion factors in driving progress through each phase remained unexplored. This study sheds light on the critical function of public administration in supporting club organization, with a focus on the behaviors of staff members in local boards of education as an intentional promotion factor. Our research aimed to identify the key dimensions of staff behavior during the organizing phase. We collected data from 130 management members (excluding administrators) of 13 clubs established with public administration support, using mail questionnaires that assessed 39 items related to staff behavior and 5 items on club organization. Factor analysis and simple regression analysis yielded two primary findings: 1) The behavioral dimensions of staff members in local boards of education comprise eight factors: coordination, securing support, setting discussions, activating discussions, accumulating credit, consideration, performance emphasis, and information provision. 2) Our results confirm that various behavioral dimensions significantly influence the transition from personal to common issue perception and from common issue perception to change intention, suggesting systematic and reciprocal relationships among behaviors in these aspects. These findings underscore the varying effectiveness of behaviors across different organizing phases and emphasize the importance of timely support for successful club organization, particularly in relation to the timing of common issue perception.\n",

A total of 18 community sports clubs in the Kinki region were selected as samples, comprising 10 nonprofit corporation clubs and 8 voluntary organization clubs. Interviews were conducted using survey items derived from Dudwick et al.'s (2006) framework, which were refined through discussions among a research representative and two collaborators. The data was analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis with text mining. The study yielded two primary findings. Firstly, managers of community sports clubs affiliated with specified nonprofit corporations tended to prioritize building networks with neighboring clubs, local governments, and community groups through collaborative efforts. Secondly, voluntarily organized community sports clubs focused on developing internal networks by coordinating the use of school facilities. These results suggest that social capital developed by managers of nonprofit corporation-affiliated clubs tends to radiate outward, whereas that developed by voluntarily organized clubs tends to be more inward-focused.\"\n",

However, achieving sustainable growth remains a challenge, with some CSCs even facing dissolution. Therefore, it is essential to establish an effective management approach. To explore and develop a viable management strategy for CSCs, we investigated their growth by examining the creation, implementation, and dissemination of mission statements. A nationwide questionnaire survey of 738 CSCs was conducted to achieve this objective.\n",

Our results suggest that incorporating the mission statement into the CSC's management cycle and having CSC leadership drive the mission statement are effective management strategies.\n",
      "3. The growth of CSCs was found to be closely tied to the implementation of mission management and the dissemination of the mission statement. Consequently, promoting the dissemination of the mission statement through effective mission management will also foster the growth of CSCs.

Coach M's paternal guidance and influence had inspired A to work tirelessly as captain, fostering a comfortable atmosphere within the club. A's strong sense of responsibility, driven by his gratitude towards M, ultimately promoted the revival of the club. This resilience was fueled by A's desire to pass on the tradition of the club to future generations, a priority shared by M even in the face of crisis. A's enduring feelings of gratitude stemmed from Coach M's paternal care since his graduation from Junior Soccer Club C, which had evolved into an extraordinary bond between coach and player before A joined Club E.

      "The social human service market has traditionally been comprised of both commercial companies and non-profit organizations. Similarly, sports club management also involves a mix of these two types of entities. According to Tanimoto (2005), when selecting an organizational form, four key factors come into play: market constraints, financial constraints, legal constraints, and social constraints. He also proposed the concept of an organizational portfolio strategy, which leverages the strengths of both for-profit and non-profit organizations. To validate this theory, we conducted case studies on local sports clubs, including Vegalta Sendai Co., Ltd., Montedio Yamagata Inc., Shonan Bellmare, and Tohoku Rakuten Eagles. Our findings confirm that Tanimoto's theory holds true, even for highly commercial professional league teams. Additionally, our study reveals that a local team like Tsukuba FC effectively utilizes its limited resources by adopting the organizational portfolio strategy. In contrast, another local team, Shiogama FC Inc., prioritizes management through its local network and opted for a non-profit organization. Our conclusion is that community-based club management often faces financial constraints, highlighting the importance of leveraging a citizenship network around the organization to achieve effective management.\n",
